Different companies call their employees differently. But Saloni herself prefers to be called a Developer because Engineer, to her, is more hardware/mechanical related.

Since then she has been working in core software development roles. Just so happened that every 2 years she has switched companies.

But she leans towards backend a little more. According to her, all fullstack developers lean towards one or the other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-being-interview-ready\">Being Interview-Ready</h2>\n<p>Saloni believes in being interview ready in the sense that she does not want to be at the mercy of any employer. She started a series of sessions hosted on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.womenwhocode.com/\">WomenWhoCode</a> Singapore's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/LvGWPEa1izw?si=Vhgk4CvgnCNctall\">platform</a>.

Therefore, Saloni started these sessions of mock interviews where she would practice her interviewing skills and also be up to date as an interviewee. She believes Teaching is the best way to learn, so she is always sharing her knowledge with the community.</p>\n<p>With this she learnt what it takes to be an above average software developer and then gave an example in the podcast where she she was able to ask the interviewer some tough questions because she knows she did well in the interview and then went on to interviewing the interviewer. She asked “do you (as the tech lead) believe in mentorship among the team or more self-learning?” These kind of questions help her gauge the kind of employer she is dealing with and how her experience will be in the company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-robust-code\">Robust Code</h2>\n<p>In the episode, Victoria asks about how to explain robust code to a non-programmer. Saloni explained that robust code would mean code that gracefully handles all scenarios and does not break with edge cases.</p>\n<p>Also, longer code is not necessarily bad code, it might mean that it’s more modularised or easier to understand.
