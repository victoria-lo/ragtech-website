00:00 I've had a lot of experiences with
00:02 

00:02 people who were managers but weren't
00:04 

00:04 self-aware that they were bad managers.
00:06 

00:06 >> I don't think how I'm gonna how I'm
00:08 

00:08 going to give like okay we have this
00:09 

00:09 pool of money we now have to give this
00:11 

00:11 much increments to this these people.
00:13 

00:13 >> I don't know how to do that.
00:14 

00:14 >> It's very hard to determine who's a good
00:18 

00:18 manager or not. It it's very hard from
00:19 

00:19 like HR perspective as well.
00:25 

00:25 >> Hello there. Welcome to Reag, the place
00:27 

00:27 for bites and mentor. I'm Natasha. I'm a
00:29 

00:29 software engineer.
00:30 

00:30 >> Salony software developer and I'm
00:32 

00:32 Victoria solutions engineer.
00:33 

00:33 >> And today's topic will be about the two
00:36 

00:36 routes in software engineering. One the
00:38 

00:38 managerial route and two the individual
00:40 

00:40 contributor route. So for starters we're
00:42 

00:42 going to explain what these two routes
00:44 

00:44 are. So typically as a software engineer
00:47 

00:47 I don't know if other like vocations
00:49 

00:49 actually have this but in terms of
00:51 

00:51 career progression you have two routes.
00:53 

00:53 one, you progress on to become a manager
00:55 

00:55 where you lead teams and lead people and
00:57 

00:57 then you become uh uh like bigger and
01:00 

01:00 bigger managers as you go along or two
01:03 

01:03 uh there's the individual contributor
01:04 

01:04 route where uh you become a greater uh
01:08 

01:08 expert at what uh you're doing in that
01:10 

01:10 specific field. I really wanted to
01:12 

01:12 explore like for all of us here if you
01:16 

01:16 had a choice which usually we do have a
01:18 

01:18 choice right your engineering manager
01:19 

01:19 will come down and ask you like hey um
01:21 

01:21 in terms of promotion like which route
01:23 

01:23 would you want to do like for uh all of
01:26 

01:26 us here what our uh preferences are. So
01:29 

01:29 maybe we can start with Victoria because
01:31 

01:31 I know you used to be in a larger
01:33 

01:33 organization and now you're in a
01:35 

01:35 startup. So how has that change kind of
01:38 

01:38 shifted your thoughts about what route
01:40 

01:40 you would preferably go into?
01:42 

01:42 >> Uh yeah I think for me naturally I think
01:46 

01:46 I excel well like just executing stuff
01:49 

01:49 and doing stuff. So initially I thought
01:52 

01:52 I would you know always choose the IC
01:54 

01:54 role and just keep beingcoming a subject
01:57 

01:57 matter expert and I like to keep going
01:59 

01:59 up that way. Uh but because now I've
02:02 

02:02 transitioned into this startup, I kind
02:04 

02:04 of have to put on different hats and
02:06 

02:06 naturally I have to step up and become
02:09 

02:09 the lead of my team and that would
02:11 

02:11 involve some people like managing kind
02:14 

02:14 of skills
02:15 

02:15 >> and I wouldn't say I you know I don't
02:18 

02:18 want to do it but it's more like it
02:20 

02:20 would be out of my comfort zone and I
02:22 

02:22 really have to consciously learn the
02:24 

02:24 skills and like read books on it and
02:27 

02:27 like try to build the skill to like
02:29 

02:29 actually learn how to lead a team and
02:31 

02:31 learn how to motivate people. Um, it's
02:35 

02:35 because this is something that no one
02:37 

02:37 will teach us how to do. Like when you
02:39 

02:39 step up into this people manager role,
02:40 

02:40 you kind of have to kind of learn it on
02:43 

02:43 your own.
02:43 

02:43 >> That's true. Nobody teaches you how to
02:44 

02:44 be a good manager.
02:46 

02:46 >> Exactly. And the only way you can learn
02:48 

02:48 how is essentially from your managers,
02:51 

02:51 right? Like kind of right like they can
02:53 

02:53 be your role models, but um I don't have
02:55 

02:55 that many exposures uh to different
02:58 

02:58 types of managers. So when I came into
03:00 

03:00 this role um yeah I don't have much
03:02 

03:02 resource to work with other than books
03:05 

03:05 and podcast
03:07 

03:07 >> and yeah basically external resources
03:09 

03:09 right
03:10 

03:10 >> and I discover a lot about myself during
03:12 

03:12 this process especially like
03:14 

03:14 transitioning into these leadership
03:16 

03:16 roles is that yeah like no one is born
03:18 

03:18 as a people manager like no one starts
03:20 

03:20 out like immediately natural at it but
03:22 

03:22 if you really put in the time and effort
03:25 

03:25 to learning and building these skills it
03:27 

03:27 is more than possible that anyone can do
03:29 

03:29 it and but of course I'm not saying like
03:31 

03:31 >> I'm great at it. I'm still learning as I
03:33 

03:33 go but I think having that open mind is
03:37 

03:37 good because I initially really like
03:39 

03:39 thought I'm just going one path. Right.
03:41 

03:41 >> Yeah.
03:42 

03:42 >> Yeah. That's interesting because like I
03:44 

03:44 uh I've really been dwelling a lot about
03:46 

03:46 this thing called the peers principle
03:47 

03:47 which is that people basically get
03:49 

03:49 promoted to their highest highest level
03:52 

03:52 of incompetence. Basically, it's saying
03:54 

03:54 that a person promotes all the way up.
03:57 

03:57 And you're promoted usually based on how
03:59 

03:59 you do in your current job, but somehow
04:02 

04:02 your expertise in your current job
04:04 

04:04 shouldn't dictate how well you manage
04:05 

04:05 people. But still, most promotional
04:08 

04:08 routes only offer you managerial routes.
04:10 

04:10 So, you're good at your current job,
04:11 

04:11 then you get promoted to the next role,
04:13 

04:13 and now you're managing people, and you
04:15 

04:15 stop promoting basically at the stage
04:17 

04:17 where you stop being good at your job.
04:18 

04:18 So basically the Peter's principle talks
04:21 

04:21 about how all the man most of the
04:23 

04:23 managers you see who are kind of uh
04:25 

04:25 stagnant in their current role have
04:27 

04:27 promoted to their highest level of
04:29 

04:29 incompetence and it's really brought
04:31 

04:31 about the view uh that I have which is
04:34 

04:34 that some people are just not meant to
04:36 

04:36 be managers. they should be individual
04:38 

04:38 contributors because they were so good
04:40 

04:40 at a job. But somehow because the
04:41 

04:41 organization only allows them to promote
04:44 

04:44 to become uh managers and then manager
04:46 

04:46 above a manager. They aren't able to
04:48 

04:48 excel as well as they should and they
04:50 

04:50 stop bringing the value that they used
04:51 

04:51 to bring as an individual contributor in
04:53 

04:53 their previous role. But now what you're
04:55 

04:55 saying is that you feel nobody's born to
04:57 

04:57 be a good manager. You can evolve to
04:59 

04:59 become one if you're conscious uh about
05:02 

05:02 uh where your strengths and weaknesses
05:04 

05:04 are. If you go out there, you're
05:05 

05:05 actually very very resourceful where you
05:08 

05:08 noted that you lack exposure to a lot of
05:10 

05:10 managers. So, you went on to read uh
05:13 

05:13 books, went on to watch podcasts, and I
05:15 

05:15 really don't think a lot of people do
05:17 

05:17 this. I feel like a lot I I've had a lot
05:20 

05:20 of experiences of people who were
05:21 

05:21 managers but weren't self-aware that
05:23 

05:23 they were bad managers. So, they don't
05:26 

05:26 really go that extra mile uh that you
05:28 

05:28 did to look out for resources. Yeah,
05:31 

05:31 that's why I think like uh what you
05:33 

05:33 mentioned about the Peter's principle, I
05:35 

05:35 think that makes a lot of sense. Like
05:36 

05:36 some people um like I said, no, no one
05:38 

05:38 is born to be a good manager, but there
05:40 

05:40 are people who have naturally good uh
05:43 

05:43 qualities
05:45 

05:45 >> that makes a good manager like there
05:47 

05:47 there's naturally people who are good at
05:49 

05:49 with people, you know, like who who is
05:52 

05:52 who is able to motivate people like
05:53 

05:53 easily without external help or
05:55 

05:55 resources, right? Right. I would say
05:57 

05:57 those people they would have a natural
05:59 

05:59 tendency to get into the root of
06:03 

06:03 becoming a people manager. Uh whereas
06:06 

06:06 for me I'm I'm kind of in the um it's
06:09 

06:09 not like I I willingly go into it but
06:11 

06:11 I'm kind of like I have to.
06:14 

06:14 >> And so I would say for my type of people
06:17 

06:17 that would be seeking help and really
06:19 

06:19 trying to self-improve. And you
06:20 

06:20 mentioned maybe not a lot of people are
06:22 

06:22 self-aware. Um,
06:24 

06:24 >> that's why I think it's important to
06:25 

06:25 also reflect. It's like when you're
06:27 

06:27 already at the people manager role,
06:30 

06:30 maybe you don't get feedback as often.
06:33 

06:33 >> That's true. Yeah. The higher up you
06:34 

06:34 are, the fewer people there are above
06:36 

06:36 you, right?
06:37 

06:37 >> Yes. And not a lot of people have a lot
06:39 

06:39 of visibility like people above you
06:41 

06:41 don't have a lot of visibility on what
06:43 

06:43 you're doing dayto-day. So, they cannot
06:45 

06:45 give comments on how are you as a
06:46 

06:46 manager,
06:47 

06:47 >> right? M
06:48 

06:48 >> and and the employees can give that
06:52 

06:52 feedback to them why like they would be
06:54 

06:54 quite afraid to do so and maybe they try
06:57 

06:57 to be politically you know correct
06:59 

06:59 >> that makes it difficult for you to gain
07:02 

07:02 that self-awareness so I also get from
07:04 

07:04 that perspective but overall for me at
07:07 

07:07 least I tend to see myself more
07:09 

07:09 objectively I try to and I can see that
07:13 

07:13 you know this is something I need to
07:14 

07:14 work on
07:15 

07:15 >> and that's why I am actively working on
07:17 

07:17 it
07:18 

07:18 >> and I know that I I like to see so for
07:21 

07:21 me even though I'm like a team lead I do
07:23 

07:23 not treat myself as one you know put
07:25 

07:25 myself in a position of
07:26 

07:26 >> that's still okay
07:27 

07:27 >> yeah I will talk to my juniors the same
07:30 

07:30 way that I talk to if I were an IC
07:32 

07:32 basically I'll ask them for their
07:34 

07:34 opinions I'll ask them yeah like I want
07:36 

07:36 them to get involved and I see them as
07:38 

07:38 someone equal that someone I can learn
07:40 

07:40 from because I always believe um we're
07:42 

07:42 all eternal teachers and students we
07:45 

07:45 always learn from each other It doesn't
07:47 

07:47 matter like these are just titles and
07:49 

07:49 these are just you know job scopes like
07:51 

07:51 that what we're supposed to be doing but
07:53 

07:53 everyone can contribute that's what I
07:55 

07:55 believe in so I will always you know get
07:58 

07:58 them involved ask them for their
07:59 

07:59 opinions and I value their opinions as
08:01 

08:01 well.
08:01 

08:01 >> Yeah.
08:01 

08:01 >> Yeah. So I think that's my approach
08:04 

08:04 >> to being a manager.
08:05 

08:05 >> Yeah. Yeah. I'm not saying I'm good at
08:07 

08:07 it but still learning. Still learning
08:09 

08:09 and it takes time for
08:11 

08:11 >> Yeah. Yeah, I think it's interesting
08:12 

08:12 because like for you, you've always seen
08:14 

08:14 yourself to be like the IC route,
08:17 

08:17 individual contributor all the way, but
08:18 

08:18 then you're put in an in an organization
08:20 

08:20 because by virtue it's small, you have
08:23 

08:23 no choice but to become a manager, but
08:25 

08:25 you stepped into the role, right? And
08:26 

08:26 then you started growing through there.
08:28 

08:28 Well, whereas for salon like uh if you
08:31 

08:31 had like a choice, a preference like
08:33 

08:33 which route would you choose? So I was
08:35 

08:35 also like like uh Victoria where I
08:38 

08:38 thought I'll always be icy also because
08:40 

08:40 I think as we discussed I wanted to be
08:43 

08:43 technical all the time. I didn't want to
08:45 

08:45 lose the technical coding skills because
08:48 

08:48 >> that's the impression you get of
08:50 

08:50 managers.
08:52 

08:52 >> Uh but there are actually there are some
08:54 

08:54 companies who allow who prefer the
08:57 

08:57 manager to also be half IC half manager.
08:59 

08:59 So you will pick on lesser projects but
09:01 

09:01 you are still hands-on coding
09:03 

09:03 >> and you're still part of like two other
09:05 

09:05 teams trying to uh working on things but
09:08 

09:08 also you have to do your managerial
09:10 

09:10 duties which is
09:13 

09:13 >> and I will be like a good people person
09:16 

09:16 I will be I can be but the problem the
09:19 

09:19 the problem that I see is that managers
09:23 

09:23 get have to do this thing u like you
09:25 

09:25 know look at people's
09:27 

09:27 pros and cons you know What do you call
09:29 

09:29 that?
09:30 

09:30 >> Strength.
09:31 

09:31 >> Strengths and weaknesses and then give
09:34 

09:34 them a promotion or not give them. I
09:35 

09:35 think I'll be really bad with that.
09:37 

09:37 >> Yeah. So,
09:38 

09:38 >> so because I I don't know. I have not
09:41 

09:41 been in in that position before. But I
09:43 

09:43 like to lead. I like to be a leader.
09:45 

09:45 Like I like to look at high level
09:47 

09:47 picture and like you know resolve issues
09:49 

09:49 within a team or uh see like a blocker
09:52 

09:52 from high above and like that in the
09:54 

09:54 future that might be a problem. So let's
09:55 

09:55 fix it now. like I like I like doing
09:57 

09:57 those those kind of things. But then
09:59 

09:59 when it comes to
10:01 

10:01 >> these rankings and KPIs and like I don't
10:04 

10:04 think how I'm going to how I'm going to
10:05 

10:05 give like okay we have this pool of
10:06 

10:06 money we now have to give this much
10:08 

10:08 increments to these these people.
10:10 

10:10 >> That part is stressful. Yeah, that part
10:12 

10:12 is stressful and I'm glad you brought
10:14 

10:14 that uh up because that actually is sort
10:17 

10:17 of uh the the one of the largest roles
10:19 

10:19 of managers in most organizations to to
10:22 

10:22 manage people. It's not just about like
10:24 

10:24 that one-on-one uh honing mentoring.
10:27 

10:27 It's also about fulfilling the company's
10:29 

10:29 needs which is managing these people as
10:31 

10:31 HR instruments actually if you think
10:33 

10:33 about it and it it turns something that
10:35 

10:35 sounds so human like people management
10:38 

10:38 into something so
10:39 

10:39 >> like like objective. It's just like okay
10:42 

10:42 you're ranking you you did five projects
10:44 

10:44 this year versus you did four. So this
10:46 

10:46 person is 23rd and this person is 24th
10:48 

10:48 and that's going to determine their
10:50 

10:50 bonus.
10:51 

10:51 >> Yeah. which is crazy to me.
10:53 

10:53 >> Exactly.
10:54 

10:54 >> Yeah. It's very unnatural to do that
10:56 

10:56 also. Which is why I I in in when I
10:59 

10:59 think about it, I hesitate because I
11:01 

11:01 don't like this part of that role, but I
11:03 

11:03 understand it's very much uh necessary.
11:07 

11:07 >> I I actually don't mind like I
11:08 

11:08 understand there are there are like
11:10 

11:10 certain transparent uh structures and
11:13 

11:13 checklist or whatever they that
11:15 

11:15 companies have, but my problem is at the
11:18 

11:18 end of it, it's very subjective. It's
11:20 

11:20 the manager who makes the decision and
11:22 

11:22 if it was some other manager you would
11:24 

11:24 make a different decision. So I don't
11:26 

11:26 like it that it's very manager
11:27 

11:27 dependence is like I am the master.
11:31 

11:31 >> I don't like that that it's subjective.
11:34 

11:34 >> Yeah.
11:34 

11:34 >> If it was if it could be a bit more
11:36 

11:36 objective maybe that's better.
11:39 

11:39 >> That's true.
11:40 

11:40 >> Like like everyone here would agree that
11:42 

11:42 this is it. It's obvious. Everyone like
11:44 

11:44 there's no arguing or you know
11:47 

11:47 >> Yeah. Yeah. I think that part and also
11:50 

11:50 just having been the person who's been
11:52 

11:52 under managers who who did that job and
11:55 

11:55 it's and because it's all subjective uh
11:57 

11:57 within them you know where favoritism
11:60 

11:60 actually plays right this is where
12:01 

12:01 company politics you know really comes
12:03 

12:03 into play here and it's down to that
12:05 

12:05 manager and who they like uh which will
12:08 

12:08 determine the ranking more so than like
12:11 

12:11 uh um something objective you know that
12:13 

12:13 oh I actually did this they actually did
12:15 

12:15 that and I think that's the scary part
12:17 

12:17 about being a manager, it's that you
12:19 

12:19 know you're you're singlehandedly uh
12:22 

12:22 responsible for uh the future well at
12:26 

12:26 least the work rellated future of these
12:28 

12:28 people under you. Um and it's really
12:31 

12:31 down to whether you're a good manager,
12:32 

12:32 bad manager, it's going to determine the
12:34 

12:34 lives of the people under you. Um which
12:36 

12:36 is why I still think it's very important
12:38 

12:38 to be able to have roots you can choose
12:41 

12:41 from. uh if you're you know that you're
12:44 

12:44 somebody who's uh better at the IC role
12:46 

12:46 the individual contributor role then a
12:48 

12:48 company should give you opportunities to
12:50 

12:50 promote down that line and not force you
12:51 

12:51 to become a manager where you're going
12:53 

12:53 to do a bad job and affect people down
12:55 

12:55 the line and where there are people who
12:58 

12:58 you know are okay evolving to become
12:60 

13:00 managers there should be resources
13:02 

13:02 available for uh them to uh uh retrain
13:06 

13:06 you know like the podcasts and the books
13:08 

13:08 that you talked about and also mentors
13:09 

13:09 to look up uh towards too Um so I I feel
13:13 

13:13 like rather than it being like there uh
13:15 

13:15 existing two uh tracks for you to choose
13:17 

13:17 from, companies have to be cognizant of
13:20 

13:20 the fact that firstly not everyone can
13:23 

13:23 be a good manager. Um there needs to be
13:26 

13:26 resources and training materials needed.
13:29 

13:29 Two there are also people who just don't
13:30 

13:30 want to be managers who are happy to be
13:32 

13:32 IC. I feel like and this this it depends
13:34 

13:34 on the the career season that you're in.
13:36 

13:36 there will be like a season where you're
13:38 

13:38 more inclined to be an individual
13:40 

13:40 contributor but you see yourself like
13:42 

13:42 maybe when I hit my 35s you know I would
13:45 

13:45 want to try out a managerial route but
13:46 

13:46 this this is the time where I just want
13:48 

13:48 to be a really good expert there should
13:50 

13:50 be flexibility in that uh the HR
13:53 

13:53 structure of the company so yeah perhaps
13:55 

13:55 even like what you say now you know you
13:57 

13:57 also mentioned that you used to think
13:58 

13:58 that you would go down the IC route and
14:00 

14:00 then now having experienced certain
14:02 

14:02 things in your life you're like oh I
14:03 

14:03 want to try the manager route yeah and
14:05 

14:05 companies should have like flexibility
14:07 

14:07 to offer that. At the end of the day,
14:09 

14:09 >> it would also be nice if companies can
14:11 

14:11 have a fair evaluation system on like
14:14 

14:14 their managers because again, it's very
14:17 

14:17 hard to determine who's a good manager
14:19 

14:19 or not. It it's very hard from like HR
14:22 

14:22 perspective as well, especially
14:23 

14:23 especially if it's a huge company. How
14:25 

14:25 can you tell this manager is doing what
14:27 

14:27 they're supposed to do and doing it
14:29 

14:29 well?
14:29 

14:29 >> Yeah.
14:30 

14:30 >> Right. like maybe an anonymous surveys
14:32 

14:32 and all that can help but
14:35 

14:35 >> there's a there's a li limit to that you
14:37 

14:37 know. Yes.
14:38 

14:38 >> Yeah. Because of politics and many
14:40 

14:40 reasons. So if there's a more fair
14:42 

14:42 system in place then we can identify who
14:45 

14:45 is likely to be a better manager like
14:47 

14:47 some kind of AI to predict that
14:50 

14:50 >> you know based on personality traits I
14:51 

14:51 don't know but
14:54 

14:54 >> we have an episode on MBTI just saying
14:55 

14:55 but yes
14:56 

14:56 >> there's many ways to evaluate um someone
14:60 

14:60 who's likely to be a good manager or not
15:02 

15:02 and then we can also sit them down talk
15:04 

15:04 are you interested like basically career
15:06 

15:06 progression has to be something taken
15:08 

15:08 seriously
15:09 

15:09 >> and not just something like oh you want
15:10 

15:10 a promotion, here you go. You know, just
15:13 

15:13 just take it. If not, no. All right.
15:15 

15:15 Like we cannot force them down that
15:16 

15:16 path, you know, if they're
15:17 

15:17 >> Or sometimes it's also like, oh, there's
15:19 

15:19 a vacancy, let's get the next highest
15:21 

15:21 person to just
15:22 

15:22 >> That's often that's often what happens.
15:25 

15:25 Yeah, that's the big one. Yeah, that's
15:27 

15:27 why.
15:27 

15:27 >> And I feel like that's just lazy HR, you
15:29 

15:29 know? That's just a a chess piece kind,
15:32 

15:32 oh, okay, vacant, I just put them here.
15:34 

15:34 And that's a lot of how HR usually works
15:37 

15:37 because it's so easy to do that versus
15:39 

15:39 really do the hard thinking uh into like
15:42 

15:42 I I value my managers, I value my people
15:44 

15:44 and I know like me putting certain
15:46 

15:46 people in certain roles is going to
15:48 

15:48 affect like the company dynamics. So how
15:50 

15:50 best can I provide good training? How
15:53 

15:53 best can I provide a very dynamic uh
15:56 

15:56 career progression uh paths uh to help
15:58 

15:58 my people? And it takes like a really
16:00 

16:00 good company to do that. But yeah, this
16:02 

16:02 was a good discussion on our preferences
16:04 

16:04 between uh IC versus managerial routes.
16:07 

16:07 Uh as always, this was Rack Tag. Thank
16:09 

16:09 you for watching. Bye.
