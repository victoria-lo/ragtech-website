00:00 Is this like space data? There hasn't
00:03 

00:03 been that much like AI tools for
00:05 

00:05 geospatial
00:06 

00:06 >> there spatial database and database like
00:08 

00:08 what's the difference again like there's
00:09 

00:09 always a lot of terms around data
00:11 

00:11 engineer, data scientist, data analyst.
00:14 

00:14 What are the differences between these
00:15 

00:15 roles?
00:18 

00:18 [music]
00:21 

00:21 >> Hi everyone, welcome to RECT, the place
00:23 

00:23 where we talk about what's really behind
00:25 

00:25 the code. Let us first introduce
00:27 

00:27 ourselves. My name is Victoria. I'm a
00:28 

00:28 solutions engineer. Hi, I'm Salon,
00:31 

00:31 software developer. And I'm Natasha,
00:33 

00:33 software engineer. And today we have our
00:35 

00:35 guest, Aishwa. Hello everyone. Can you
00:38 

00:38 act like you guys are friends? You guys
00:40 

00:40 are friends. I know, but I asked her
00:43 

00:43 before this if she wants me to introduce
00:45 

00:45 her by full name or we go by. So, hello
00:48 

00:48 everyone. I'm Aishwara and I do
00:50 

00:50 geospatial data engineers. So I'm pretty
00:53 

00:53 sure a lot of you have heard about data
00:54 

00:54 engineers but um not many of you have
00:56 

00:56 heard of like geospatial like data
00:58 

00:58 engineer or the term geospatial
01:00 

01:00 geospatial data with like a location for
01:03 

01:03 example think of it like a data with has
01:05 

01:05 it address or like a postal codes or
01:08 

01:08 even like geome coordinates. So these um
01:11 

01:11 datas basically tell you where exactly a
01:14 

01:14 certain location is like on earth. So
01:16 

01:16 that's what I do. So I make sure that um
01:18 

01:18 using all these geographic data I clean
01:21 

01:21 it up and make sure that it's actually
01:22 

01:22 accessible for humans to use.
01:25 

01:25 >> Is this like space data?
01:27 

01:27 >> Yes.
01:27 

01:27 >> I guess governments would probably be
01:29 

01:29 using this to evaluate.
01:31 

01:31 >> Yeah. So there are like data sets from
01:33 

01:33 the for example the like NASA or like
01:36 

01:36 even our own government as well and so
01:38 

01:38 we get data from there and then we like
01:40 

01:40 clean it up and automate it and then use
01:42 

01:42 it for the like data scientist or the
01:45 

01:45 data analyst. I have a question and also
01:47 

01:47 for the folks who don't know like
01:48 

01:48 there's always a lot of uh terms around
01:51 

01:51 data engineer, data scientist, data
01:53 

01:53 analyst. Maybe would you like to explain
01:55 

01:55 what are the differences between these
01:57 

01:57 roles?
01:57 

01:57 >> Yeah, sure. So, um data engineers for
02:00 

02:00 myself what I do is that I get whatever
02:03 

02:03 the data that's been given to me and
02:04 

02:04 then I'll help you to like clean it up
02:06 

02:06 because usually like data that you get
02:08 

02:08 it's not like the perfect and it's not
02:10 

02:10 like very clean. So, what I mean by that
02:12 

02:12 is that you usually have null or missing
02:13 

02:13 values. there's always that
02:15 

02:15 inconsistency in terms of like format or
02:17 

02:17 anything. So I get all these datas and I
02:19 

02:19 clean them and I make sure like I
02:22 

02:22 automate them in or I even like get them
02:24 

02:24 to like store them in any like
02:26 

02:26 infrastructure like data infrastructures
02:29 

02:29 and what basically I do it is that I'll
02:30 

02:30 pass it over to the data scientist who
02:33 

02:33 would then build like models for example
02:35 

02:35 like machine learning models for like
02:38 

02:38 classifications
02:39 

02:39 or another thing like data analyst we
02:41 

02:41 also give them to data analyst. So what
02:43 

02:43 they do is that they analyze these like
02:44 

02:44 satellite datas and what they do is that
02:47 

02:47 they come up with policy recommendations
02:49 

02:49 for example or even just like um you
02:52 

02:52 know analyzing the outliers or what can
02:54 

02:54 be done better or what more we can do in
02:57 

02:57 depending on the problem that we are
02:59 

02:59 focusing on. So you're basically saying
03:01 

03:01 like in the data space there's data
03:03 

03:03 engineers like yourself, there's data
03:05 

03:05 scientists and there are data analysts
03:07 

03:07 and these are the people you usually
03:09 

03:09 work with or do you also work with other
03:11 

03:11 people uh across the tech uh space and
03:14 

03:14 also if you want we also have role cards
03:16 

03:16 here if you want to look through it see
03:18 

03:18 if you work uh with um anybody like in
03:21 

03:21 that deck. I probably should have
03:24 

03:24 included data scientist and data analyst
03:26 

03:26 but that was a good point. I will add it
03:27 

03:27 to the role cards. By the way, these are
03:29 

03:29 our system design cards. Uh we are
03:31 

03:31 trying to plan for a board game uh to
03:34 

03:34 make system design fun and engaging even
03:36 

03:36 for non- techies. Uh but for the
03:38 

03:38 purposes of this podcast, we're using
03:39 

03:39 these as props. And right now, um
03:42 

03:42 Aishwaria is looking at our role cards
03:44 

03:44 and seeing well you can see if there's
03:47 

03:47 any roles that users are with data
03:48 

03:48 engineer. We also do work with like
03:50 

03:50 product managers as well in case they
03:52 

03:52 need light on data as well.
03:55 

03:55 Where else? probably a backend engineer
03:58 

03:58 back as well in case like the data like
03:60 

03:60 leaks or anything cuz we want the data
04:02 

04:02 to be secure and safe cuz these are
04:05 

04:05 highly sensitive. So obviously we work
04:06 

04:06 with like backend engineers as well.
04:09 

04:09 >> Do you work with front end at all?
04:11 

04:11 >> Not really.
04:12 

04:12 >> Not really. But there are geospatial
04:14 

04:14 like front-end engineers as well cuz
04:16 

04:16 geospatial is like a domain like we just
04:18 

04:18 focus on Java data. So there's like um
04:20 

04:20 front ends like engineers working on
04:22 

04:22 like more on building like apps for them
04:25 

04:25 like geographic apps and things like
04:27 

04:27 that or even for example let's say like
04:29 

04:29 your Google Earth for example like those
04:33 

04:33 will front end engineers will get to do
04:34 

04:34 that as well.
04:35 

04:35 >> Oh like the 3D
04:39 

04:39 so like even like your Google maps as
04:40 

04:40 well. So like front end engineers like
04:42 

04:42 do that. So those are like some things
04:44 

04:44 that they do. So you also have like
04:46 

04:46 solutions engineer basically any of the
04:48 

04:48 engineers can do a geospatial. It's just
04:50 

04:50 that it's like whatever you're doing
04:52 

04:52 plus geospatial.
04:54 

04:54 It's the domain basically.
04:55 

04:55 >> It's a domain. Yeah.
04:56 

04:56 >> Yeah.
04:57 

04:57 >> It's a very specific niche domain
04:58 

04:58 knowledge. Yeah.
04:60 

04:60 >> Domains would be like there's fintech
05:02 

05:02 that's one domain.
05:03 

05:03 >> Geospatial is one domain and there's
05:05 

05:05 e-commerce
05:06 

05:06 >> something like that. So there's like web
05:08 

05:08 doain as well like so web. Yeah. So
05:10 

05:10 those are like domains and then you just
05:12 

05:12 like you can you can be anything. So
05:15 

05:15 yeah,
05:15 

05:15 >> okay. And then all of these roles come
05:16 

05:16 into play in each of the different
05:18 

05:18 lines. Yes. How they interact might be
05:21 

05:21 different.
05:21 

05:21 >> Yeah, [clears throat] definitely.
05:23 

05:23 >> Okay. Yeah, that's very interesting. Now
05:24 

05:24 that we know a little bit about real
05:27 

05:27 role and maybe some uh some types of
05:30 

05:30 roles that you work with on a day-to-day
05:32 

05:32 basis, let's time it's time to play a
05:34 

05:34 game.
05:36 

05:36 So again, this is our system design game
05:38 

05:38 that we are doing uh for this episode.
05:41 

05:41 And let us first start with the idea
05:43 

05:43 card. So the idea card is essentially
05:45 

05:45 the types of uh apps yeah that you can
05:48 

05:48 choose to essentially let's say you are
05:51 

05:51 a data engineer you are um and then you
05:54 

05:54 are doing this project right so let us
05:57 

05:57 choose one project that you want to do
05:60 

05:60 and then maybe you can walk us through
06:02 

06:02 how you would data engineer this right
06:06 

06:06 yeah so here we have eight different
06:08 

06:08 cards different idea cards feel free to
06:10 

06:10 choose one okay so all these look really
06:13 

06:13 interesting I think they're also like
06:14 

06:14 geospatial like combined. So, this is
06:17 

06:17 going to be interesting, but I'll just
06:18 

06:18 go with the one closest to me. So, which
06:20 

06:20 is this fire.
06:21 

06:21 >> It's literally I thought you were going
06:22 

06:22 to say closest to your domain, but it's
06:24 

06:24 literally the one closest.
06:25 

06:25 >> The car that I pull out is like called
06:27 

06:27 fire sense. So, essentially detect
06:29 

06:29 wildfires in real time using satellite
06:31 

06:31 data and alert nearby regions like
06:34 

06:34 instantly. So, the needs are the
06:36 

06:36 satellite feed, data pipeline, and alert
06:39 

06:39 system.
06:40 

06:40 >> Actually, I just randomly put those
06:41 

06:41 words in there. I don't know what it
06:42 

06:42 takes to build an app like that. So you
06:44 

06:44 can Okay. Well, it's a prototype. Okay.
06:46 

06:46 So, don't disregard the what it needs.
06:48 

06:48 We're singerating on that. You're going
06:50 

06:50 to tell us what it needs. All right. Cuz
06:51 

06:51 we have another deck of cards. This one
06:54 

06:54 is it you the blue one. Blue the system
06:56 

06:56 card. So, the system card is essentially
06:58 

06:58 system design components that you'll
06:60 

06:60 typically see. Uh so maybe a you can
07:02 

07:02 look through all these cards and let us
07:04 

07:04 know like what does a data engineer
07:07 

07:07 need? What components do the data
07:09 

07:09 engineer need?
07:10 

07:10 >> Okay.
07:11 

07:11 Literally my first card says like data
07:13 

07:13 warehouse. So we'll put it all there.
07:15 

07:15 We'll put all the data like pipelines as
07:17 

07:17 well, data security. These are things
07:19 

07:19 that we usually would need obviously
07:22 

07:22 when it comes with like geospatial
07:24 

07:24 stuff. So yeah, they also have the
07:26 

07:26 geoprocessor which is essentially
07:28 

07:28 performs geospatial computations and
07:30 

07:30 transformations.
07:32 

07:32 So these help you to map your like
07:34 

07:34 geospatial like map data. You also have
07:36 

07:36 like spatial database essentially um
07:39 

07:39 just a database for spatial data. So it
07:41 

07:41 helps you to like store it efficiently
07:44 

07:44 and yeah you also have web maps which
07:47 

07:47 basically displays like geospatial data
07:49 

07:49 online. Think of it like your Google
07:51 

07:51 maps. So yeah so for wildfire obviously
07:54 

07:54 you need like web maps so you can see
07:57 

07:57 where exactly like which region is
07:59 

07:59 happening and like all the heat maps as
08:01 

08:01 well. So heat maps are basically like
08:03 

08:03 the hotspots. So you know how in
08:05 

08:05 Singapore where we have really high
08:07 

08:07 temperatures and sometimes it's like
08:08 

08:08 really low temperature because it's like
08:09 

08:09 raining or something like that. So we
08:12 

08:12 heat spot heat maps are basically just
08:13 

08:13 like heat spots that tells you like when
08:15 

08:15 where is it like most humid or like
08:18 

08:18 where is it like heat is mostly there
08:20 

08:20 >> your spatial database and database like
08:22 

08:22 what's the difference again? Do you want
08:24 

08:24 to tell uh that to
08:26 

08:26 >> it's actually the difference is just
08:28 

08:28 that um the fact that one has a location
08:32 

08:32 in it as well and so when it has like a
08:35 

08:35 location I think obviously sensitivity
08:37 

08:37 is also a lot higher as well so yeah
08:39 

08:39 that's just pretty much it and also you
08:41 

08:41 have like a very specific like
08:43 

08:43 coordinate so it's like a tracker I
08:45 

08:45 would say so you have like each day you
08:47 

08:47 have like a tracker cuz like the
08:49 

08:49 location has like you track the location
08:51 

08:51 so I guess that's like the only I would
08:53 

08:53 say difference
08:54 

08:54 >> I I would think like uh I mean location
08:57 

08:57 is is one but I would think spatial
09:00 

09:00 database is maybe more high rights and
09:04 

09:04 yeah high rights and then also high read
09:06 

09:06 so it's just optimized for that purpose
09:09 

09:09 really but it's just a type of database
09:11 

09:11 like there's no SQL SQL MongoDB and
09:15 

09:15 stuff and all these have different
09:16 

09:16 advantages disadvantages so maybe in
09:19 

09:19 this case maybe it's high rights cuz
09:22 

09:22 you're tracking something so probably
09:25 

09:25 just optimized for it but it's a
09:27 

09:27 database essentially
09:28 

09:28 >> and location is always a very tricky
09:30 

09:30 data object to handle and that's why
09:32 

09:32 it's better to have like many
09:34 

09:34 >> coordinates like your xaxis y axis and
09:37 

09:37 then what other
09:38 

09:38 >> and for those people out there who
09:39 

09:39 thinks storing location is just storing
09:42 

09:42 like addresses can you explain to them
09:44 

09:44 that it's way more than that like what
09:45 

09:45 kind of fields and parameters do you
09:46 

09:46 have to consider when storing location
09:48 

09:48 data
09:49 

09:49 >> so is um we obviously look at it in like
09:51 

09:51 a there's like 2D versions of it but
09:53 

09:53 there's also like 3D versions of it then
09:55 

09:55 you have to look at it as well and also
09:57 

09:57 let's say there's like a change in
09:59 

09:59 location then we need to be like alerted
10:01 

10:01 and then you need to have alert and then
10:03 

10:03 to like make the necessary changes as
10:06 

10:06 well so things like that so we obviously
10:08 

10:08 have like um and thing about satellite
10:11 

10:11 data is that it takes a while to
10:12 

10:12 actually come so it's not real time like
10:14 

10:14 uh continuous data so usually when the
10:17 

10:17 data comes to us like things have
10:19 

10:19 already happened or like a certain
10:21 

10:21 region would have and destroy or just
10:23 

10:23 things like that from the wildfire or
10:24 

10:24 anything. So like it's very important
10:26 

10:26 that we have like the database now and
10:29 

10:29 then after that like like you know like
10:30 

10:30 frequently like change it a bit cuz the
10:32 

10:32 earth is changing and like you know
10:34 

10:34 obviously
10:35 

10:35 >> earth is changing climate change.
10:37 

10:37 >> Are there other things in the deck that
10:39 

10:39 you think might be relevant? I'll say
10:41 

10:41 like ETL pipelines as well where we
10:43 

10:43 basically get to like from the database
10:45 

10:45 we get to like actually write and like
10:46 

10:46 transform and load the like data and but
10:48 

10:48 then ETL pipelines because we also have
10:51 

10:51 like the spatial like involved as well.
10:52 

10:52 It's a lot more different I would say.
10:55 

10:55 Yeah. And then we also have like APIs as
10:58 

10:58 well so that people users can also like
10:60 

10:60 get the data as well for like in case
11:02 

11:02 they want to do like their own projects
11:04 

11:04 and everything.
11:05 

11:05 >> Thanks so much for sharing. So now we
11:06 

11:06 learned that these are all the
11:07 

11:07 components needed as your day-to-day
11:10 

11:10 role as a data engineer is you're going
11:12 

11:12 to be working with all these components.
11:14 

11:14 That's really good to know. Um in our
11:16 

11:16 next part of the game, is there any
11:18 

11:18 parts in your job, your day-to-day job
11:21 

11:21 where like you know AI can essentially
11:24 

11:24 replace or or not? So you can look
11:26 

11:26 through the tool
11:27 

11:27 >> can look through see if there are any
11:30 

11:30 relevant tools that you are actually
11:32 

11:32 using. Now, I mean, obviously they're
11:34 

11:34 all codified in different names cuz we
11:36 

11:36 don't want brands to come out.
11:37 

11:37 >> So, there is uh Google Analytics. So
11:40 

11:40 cute. We have Power Beehive.
11:43 

11:43 So, that's a new one.
11:45 

11:45 >> Never heard of that. Well, it's funny.
11:47 

11:47 Kid Journey. Natasha came up with all
11:49 

11:49 this by the way. So, so creative. I
11:52 

11:52 think my favorite one has Megma.
11:55 

11:55 [laughter]
11:56 

11:56 >> Like, if you know the me, you know how
11:58 

11:58 cuz you're Jen C. So you know as always
12:02 

12:02 >> I don't know do you know what no it's
12:04 

12:04 okay it's okay for me
12:04 

12:04 >> any tools that you
12:06 

12:06 >> so obviously um depending on what area
12:09 

12:09 of um like geospatial you do and
12:11 

12:11 definitely because like we right now
12:13 

12:13 we're focusing more on the data part so
12:15 

12:15 power beehive cuz we know you need the
12:17 

12:17 data visualization to see how like where
12:20 

12:20 are the areas of like like where are the
12:23 

12:23 certain areas of maps that we need to
12:24 

12:24 track or like um how like the damage how
12:28 

12:28 like however the damage like a certain
12:30 

12:30 area has been so power probably power
12:32 

12:32 beehive is one
12:34 

12:34 >> is there AI baked into power beehive
12:36 

12:36 grid well the real power beehive right
12:39 

12:39 now like when you use it do they have
12:41 

12:41 like special AI features
12:43 

12:43 >> um not that I know of like
12:45 

12:45 >> just a m analytics uh visualization uh
12:48 

12:48 platform
12:50 

12:50 >> we also have like co-il like co-pilot
12:52 

12:52 like cat and GBT usually we use AI to
12:55 

12:55 help us like clean the data faster maybe
12:57 

12:57 that's also one thing or to like help us
12:59 

12:59 to automate the data faster when what we
13:03 

13:03 don't need AI for or like I don't think
13:05 

13:05 AI will help us replace is things like
13:07 

13:07 human judgment and accountability. So
13:10 

13:10 like I mentioned earlier because we use
13:11 

13:11 these datas to like all these data
13:13 

13:13 analystic we use the data to um make
13:16 

13:16 policy recommendations or to like have
13:19 

13:19 new implements or any new features that
13:21 

13:21 we need and so like things like that you
13:23 

13:23 can't really have like AI to help us as
13:26 

13:26 well and AI helps you to detect the
13:28 

13:28 patterns that's happening but they don't
13:30 

13:30 really like get to tell you like exactly
13:32 

13:32 why such patterns is happening or
13:34 

13:34 something like that. For example, like
13:36 

13:36 um in Indonesian there's like wildfires
13:38 

13:38 happening around like Indonesia. I'm
13:41 

13:41 sure you can relate. And like um it
13:44 

13:44 tells you like where exactly it's going
13:45 

13:45 to happen. I think it can also tell you
13:46 

13:46 like a predictability like well in the
13:49 

13:49 next region but like it wouldn't tell
13:51 

13:51 you like why not like you've gone you
13:54 

13:54 gone over to Indonesian like see why or
13:57 

13:57 you know if there's any like is it cause
13:59 

13:59 of deforestation or like it's like a
14:01 

14:01 man-made thing or it's like a nature
14:03 

14:03 like a natural thing. So those are
14:06 

14:06 things that AIs can't really like um
14:08 

14:08 predict for us. So that's where humans
14:10 

14:10 like us need to step in and to see as
14:13 

14:13 well. So things like that and like um
14:16 

14:16 even just like for example like planning
14:18 

14:18 out your city route and stuff like that
14:20 

14:20 for like example like a new train line
14:22 

14:22 that's happening like the Jurong like uh
14:25 

14:25 train line that's called JRL if I'm not
14:27 

14:27 wrong and then like for example like
14:29 

14:29 some of the walkways are like obviously
14:31 

14:31 blocked and restricted due to the uh
14:33 

14:33 construction area. So those are things
14:35 

14:35 that AI is currently like predicting or
14:37 

14:37 anything. These are some things that
14:38 

14:38 like you know that humans need to like
14:40 

14:40 manually update in like a database for
14:42 

14:42 example. So these are the things that
14:44 

14:44 like you know AI don't can really
14:46 

14:46 replace us but it does help us make our
14:48 

14:48 like lives fast like help us lives
14:50 

14:50 smoother helps us like an like automate
14:53 

14:53 the data faster I would say. Oh, at
14:55 

14:55 least can I ask like how exactly is AI
14:58 

14:58 helping you do things
15:01 

15:01 automate faster? Like are you asking it
15:03 

15:03 to write scripts for you in that manner
15:06 

15:06 or are you just here's our database
15:09 

15:09 clean this up? Like what kind of prompts
15:12 

15:12 do you would you give?
15:14 

15:14 >> Yeah, like those are like um some
15:16 

15:16 prompts you can give as well like
15:17 

15:17 helping you to like clean the data
15:19 

15:19 faster. So you give it access to your
15:22 

15:22 database like I'm imagining billions of
15:24 

15:24 records in the database.
15:26 

15:26 >> You can give it like a sample of it like
15:28 

15:28 to see or you can even give them like a
15:30 

15:30 sample to try to analyze as well just
15:32 

15:32 like get like a GI gist of what's
15:34 

15:34 happening. Those are like some ways you
15:37 

15:37 can do this. Why then what AI would we
15:39 

15:39 use like chat GPT right like it
15:41 

15:41 >> are there AI tools in your specific
15:43 

15:43 field? Obviously this deck is based on
15:45 

15:45 like our knowledge and what we know but
15:47 

15:47 we're not geospatial engineers. What
15:49 

15:49 would you recommend that we put in a
15:51 

15:51 deck that you've been using? Are there
15:53 

15:53 like tools that uh like you said in this
15:55 

15:55 case clean data faster? Um tools that
15:59 

15:59 connect maybe directly to the database
16:00 

16:00 and then clean it all up for you.
16:03 

16:03 >> Maybe it's just a program.
16:04 

16:04 >> Maybe program like a very specific
16:07 

16:07 program like there hasn't been that much
16:09 

16:09 like AI like tools for geospatial but
16:12 

16:12 there are like it's still like
16:13 

16:13 happening. It's still like slowly like
16:15 

16:15 building on. I think dual AI is a thing
16:18 

16:18 as well. I think you're like creating it
16:20 

16:20 or it's already been created when this
16:22 

16:22 video comes up. But yeah, so that's like
16:24 

16:24 one of them.
16:25 

16:25 >> It seems right now like if we were to
16:27 

16:27 ask you is AI helping you or is AI
16:30 

16:30 replacing you? It it seems that it isn't
16:32 

16:32 really disrupting your workflow because
16:34 

16:34 they're just uh it's a niche. That's one
16:38 

16:38 uh probably uh uh not really uh put in
16:41 

16:41 the spotlight yet for people to be like,
16:42 

16:42 "Oh yeah, we can use AI here." But what
16:44 

16:44 you've been using is just like very
16:46 

16:46 day-to-day using chatbt. Give it sample
16:49 

16:49 and then tell me like what uh fields I
16:52 

16:52 might want to take a look at. Tell me
16:53 

16:53 what fields might need more cleaning.
16:55 

16:55 You know, then you will write the actual
16:57 

16:57 script to clean it.
16:58 

16:58 >> Yeah.
16:58 

16:58 >> So it's one of the interesting like
17:01 

17:01 domains that it uses a lot of like
17:03 

17:03 physical aspects and as well as human
17:05 

17:05 aspects. So like you know there's so
17:07 

17:07 much like um like science like um like
17:10 

17:10 satellite data understanding how
17:12 

17:12 satellite data comes about. It's a lot
17:13 

17:13 of like geography related as well
17:15 

17:15 because you kind of know like things
17:17 

17:17 like purple maps like purple graphs and
17:19 

17:19 like um satellite imagery and things
17:22 

17:22 like that and also you do need like
17:24 

17:24 humans to kind of look at the maps as
17:26 

17:26 well. So like those are things that like
17:29 

17:29 it's there there's a lot of like human
17:30 

17:30 like um judgment involved I would say.
17:33 

17:33 This was one of those things that hasn't
17:35 

17:35 been like um it's slowly like been
17:37 

17:37 trying to make things like AI generated
17:39 

17:39 or like slowly getting AI to automate
17:41 

17:41 but like as far as I've known and seen
17:44 

17:44 is still a upcoming like it's still
17:46 

17:46 pretty new I would say especially here
17:49 

17:49 in Singapore like not that many people
17:50 

17:50 like talk about it. So like a lot like
17:53 

17:53 my even like my knowledge came from like
17:54 

17:54 LinkedIn like people on LinkedIn and
17:56 

17:56 like UDI course. So shout out to all
17:58 

17:58 these people. So it's still like it's
17:60 

17:60 still relatively like new and people are
18:02 

18:02 still trying to explore those areas as
18:03 

18:03 well. You talk a lot about what AI
18:06 

18:06 cannot replace and maybe things that you
18:08 

18:08 know require a lot of human judgment in
18:10 

18:10 your day-to-day role. I was thinking
18:11 

18:11 like maybe you can talk about what are
18:13 

18:13 some common challenges in geospatial and
18:16 

18:16 do you think AI can solve it or is that
18:20 

18:20 AI can solve it? I would say like one of
18:23 

18:23 them is just like having more like real
18:25 

18:25 time like data like getting data like u
18:28 

18:28 come through like process through like a
18:29 

18:29 lot faster. I think that's something
18:31 

18:31 that I would like like AI to solve
18:33 

18:33 because of like on the flow of events
18:35 

18:35 right obviously with like natural
18:37 

18:37 disasters like response like uh
18:39 

18:39 emergency like response like those two
18:41 

18:41 things like it could I hope we can speed
18:44 

18:44 up like the time. So what I mean by that
18:46 

18:46 is like by time we like um like we kind
18:50 

18:50 of like know there's like a event that's
18:52 

18:52 happening like an environment disaster
18:53 

18:53 like a flood is happening. I wish we
18:55 

18:55 could um or even things happens like um
18:59 

18:59 some things we are able to kind of like
19:00 

19:00 oh we can tell there's like a flood
19:01 

19:01 that's going to happen or there's a
19:02 

19:02 earthquake that's going to happen but
19:04 

19:04 some things that we just cannot like um
19:06 

19:06 predict or it just happens like um
19:09 

19:09 happens on the spot. So like you know by
19:11 

19:11 the time we like figure about it and
19:13 

19:13 everything or like even think of it in
19:15 

19:15 the long term like and there's like
19:17 

19:17 short-term effects as like so there's
19:18 

19:18 short-term effects and long-term effects
19:20 

19:20 as like short-term solutions and
19:22 

19:22 long-term solutions and I hope that like
19:24 

19:24 AIS could help us like provide more of
19:26 

19:26 like a long-term solutions to these
19:28 

19:28 problems maybe especially for example
19:31 

19:31 like things like housing policies or
19:34 

19:34 like things like that and so like those
19:36 

19:36 are things that like um for example like
19:39 

19:39 wildfire right and and um in destroys
19:41 

19:41 like homes and everything. And so like
19:43 

19:43 we would like to um get those data as
19:46 

19:46 fast as possible to help these people as
19:48 

19:48 well so that we can help them like
19:50 

19:50 aftermath or like bring them to a more
19:53 

19:53 safer location. And so
19:55 

19:55 >> so you're talking more about like you
19:56 

19:56 hope for there to be more innovations or
19:59 

19:59 like the data like actually fetching the
20:01 

20:01 data. So maybe you're talking about like
20:03 

20:03 the sensors over there yourself a wider
20:06 

20:06 availability and then would would this
20:08 

20:08 also be like the pipelines that you're
20:10 

20:10 talking about like is there I don't
20:12 

20:12 think it's an issue with the pipelines
20:14 

20:14 issue of pipelines like the sensors the
20:16 

20:16 harder part is the hardest part of like
20:18 

20:18 geospatial is the collection of data I
20:20 

20:20 would say cuz it's very like it is um
20:23 

20:23 collecting is one thing and also like
20:24 

20:24 it's really really like messy and
20:26 

20:26 inconsistent as well. So like it takes a
20:29 

20:29 long time to clean up those like data as
20:31 

20:31 well.
20:31 

20:31 >> Well, that's definitely something AI can
20:33 

20:33 do.
20:34 

20:34 >> But we need to first solve the problem
20:36 

20:36 of collection of data.
20:37 

20:37 >> Yeah. Only if we give the input to the
20:39 

20:39 AI then it can do something about it.
20:42 

20:42 Yeah. And produce results and solutions.
20:44 

20:44 >> We probably need to get like somebody in
20:46 

20:46 the IoT the census space on this show.
20:49 

20:49 Thank you so much for sharing. I She's
20:52 

20:52 your friend Victoria. I have camera shy
20:54 

20:54 issues back almost two years of rag tech
20:56 

20:56 and she's still camera shy.
20:58 

20:58 >> Thank you Ashish for sharing.
20:59 

20:59 >> Thank you Rick. Thank you Sonia and
