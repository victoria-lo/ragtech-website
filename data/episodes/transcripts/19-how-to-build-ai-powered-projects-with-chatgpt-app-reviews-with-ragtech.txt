00:17 

00:17 doing a special episode oh so Lo came
00:20 

00:20 with soft ey but as you can see we're
00:22 

00:22 slightly unhinged right
00:25 

00:25 now this is a very different format of
00:28 

00:28 video uh but we wanted to try something
00:30 

00:30 you out aside from our usual podcasts uh
00:33 

00:33 formats uh and to be able to bring a
00:36 

00:36 little bit of code a little bit of
00:38 

00:38 application a little bit of well our
00:40 

00:40 usual benter style um but in this new
00:44 

00:44 format um through sort of like an online
00:47 

00:47 stream uh so today what we decided to do
00:51 

00:51 is uh we're going to review an app that
00:54 

00:54 is built by one of us and we might
00:56 

00:56 continue this as a series if like the
00:58 

00:58 feedback is good but uh the person that
01:01 

01:01 we're going to review the app is salones
01:05 

01:05 also in case you don't know oh we should
01:07 

01:07 introduce ourselves I know our names are
01:08 

01:08 there but yeah Salone you can introduce
01:11 

01:11 yourself since today you're going to be
01:13 

01:13 our guest
01:14 

01:14 star hello everyone I'm sonone a
01:17 

01:17 software
01:18 

01:18 developer and co-host
01:21 

01:21 here yeah I'm Natasha software engineer
01:26 

01:26 also co-host here and I'm Victoria also
01:31 

01:31 uh not also I'm Solutions engineer I'm
01:35 

01:35 also co-host here yeah and if you want
01:38 

01:38 to find out what like a Solutions
01:39 

01:39 engineer or a software developer does
01:41 

01:41 click our previous videos we do cover
01:43 

01:43 each and every one of us in an in-depth
01:45 

01:45 like self- inro video as well as talking
01:47 

01:47 about what our jobs entail so you can
01:49 

01:49 check that out so yeah without further
01:51 

01:51 Ado I know we're all kind of awkward
01:53 

01:53 here because we're trying to get used to
01:55 

01:55 this format but Victoria and I have not
01:58 

01:58 seen this app soone has been telling us
02:00 

02:00 about it uh for quite a while now we
02:03 

02:03 know she's been building it we know it's
02:05 

02:05 about food but that's about all we know
02:07 

02:07 we've not really seen the app yet so I
02:09 

02:09 think first and
02:11 

02:11 foremost um yeah what is your app about
02:14 

02:14 and yeah you can take the stage
02:17 

02:17 Soo yes so I would first like to make
02:21 

02:21 some things clear it's not a very
02:22 

02:22 impressive app it was just me tinkering
02:25 

02:25 with open Ai and trying to see exactly
02:29 

02:29 what's what it's all about and how we
02:31 

02:31 can use it and so okay why did I even
02:35 

02:35 come up with this app was because I
02:37 

02:37 actually am getting health conscious and
02:40 

02:40 so you know how skittles here Skittles
02:44 

02:44 it has I can't tell if it's if it's like
02:49 

02:49 yeah if it's healthy or not like of
02:53 

02:53 course it's not healthy but if you
02:55 

02:55 really want to know if it's healthy or
02:56 

02:56 not uh you can you can actually look at
02:59 

02:59 this like nutrition label thingy wait
03:01 

03:01 where am I pointing you're not pointing
03:04 

03:04 right go go left or right yeah yeah yeah
03:07 

03:07 you got it yeah so this nutrition label
03:10 

03:10 I don't know how many of you can
03:12 

03:12 actually read this but I actually do not
03:15 

03:15 understand if it's what exactly it's all
03:17 

03:17 about like protein energy cholesterol is
03:20 

03:20 it good is it bad I mean how much is
03:22 

03:22 good is bad so then I was like you know
03:25 

03:25 what let's just this is like a good use
03:27 

03:27 case for me to make like a very simple
03:29 

03:29 app where I just pass in this nutrition
03:32 

03:32 information to Chad GP and it is able to
03:35 

03:35 tell me exactly what I want to know
03:37 

03:37 which is should I eat this or not at the
03:40 

03:40 moment so it's a binary yes or no kind
03:43 

03:43 of thing no I actually wanted yes or no
03:47 

03:47 uh with some information like you know
03:49 

03:49 how much is it very sugary is it not so
03:53 

03:53 much can I just eat it right now
03:55 

03:55 something like that so I just went about
03:58 

03:58 will you really just throw it away
04:00 

04:00 or what I going to do with it I will let
04:04 

04:04 my guilt conscious take
04:09 

04:09 effect I Del it okay got it yeah it's so
04:15 

04:15 why are you food conscious in the first
04:17 

04:17 place oh is it because like of your
04:19 

04:19 division board you had and then you had
04:22 

04:22 like I want to be more healthy this year
04:24 

04:24 I remember seeing that at your place uh
04:27 

04:27 yes healthy in general yes and you're
04:30 

04:30 beautiful the way you are
04:33 

04:33 right thank
04:35 

04:35 you but like you know you know a lot of
04:38 

04:38 things like you don't actually know that
04:40 

04:40 uh they are healthy or not and also that
04:44 

04:44 there are alternate versions of it that
04:46 

04:46 are healthier like the I was talking
04:48 

04:48 Victoria telling her that did you know
04:49 

04:49 that there was something called
04:51 

04:51 cauliflower chips so instead of potato
04:54 

04:54 chips you can eat cauliflower chips I
04:56 

04:56 didn't know that chip the organic
04:59 

04:59 section
05:00 

05:00 giant chips yeah banana chips yeah yeah
05:05 

05:05 slow exploring the health food area
05:08 

05:08 health food section yes in grocery
05:11 

05:11 stores so does the app give you
05:13 

05:13 alternative to go there it doesn't it
05:15 

05:15 doesn't do that it's not that awesome
05:17 

05:17 yet I haven't made it awesome yet but it
05:20 

05:20 does tell me if this is good or not at
05:22 

05:22 the moment let me show you this app of
05:26 

05:26 mine so it is I've like hosted it on ver
05:30 

05:30 so uh and this is how it looks like very
05:32 

05:32 very simple this is on my web on on web
05:36 

05:36 browser so that therefore it's like
05:37 

05:37 super huge but it'll be nice and small
05:40 

05:40 on a mobile screen so how it works is
05:43 

05:43 all you have to do is click on open
05:46 

05:46 camera and it's this camera so let's
05:50 

05:50 actually see Skittles I've actually not
05:52 

05:52 tried it so let's see what what happen
05:54 

05:54 so if I let
05:57 

05:57 me take a so here can it see clearly I
06:02 

06:02 think I think it's there's a sheen on it
06:05 

06:05 because of the
06:06 

06:06 gloss but CH is actually quite smart it
06:10 

06:10 it should be able to read
06:12 

06:12 this so it says it is
06:16 

06:16 bad very good
06:18 

06:18 Chad the food is high in sugar contains
06:21 

06:21 no protein or dietary fiber it also
06:23 

06:23 contains artificial colors and other
06:26 

06:26 additives this can contribute to health
06:28 

06:28 issues like tooth decay and is
06:31 

06:31 considered unhealthy and therefore I
06:34 

06:34 shall not be eating this now are you
06:37 

06:37 going to throw it so that's my very
06:39 

06:39 simple app no I actually will eat itth
06:42 

06:42 sometimes if I do
06:44 

06:44 like right one small one wouldn't harm
06:47 

06:47 me maybe like eating five at a go might
06:49 

06:49 yeah maybe like a future feature it's
06:51 

06:51 like caveat you can technically half
06:54 

06:54 like one a day that's okay maybe I don't
06:57 

06:57 know but oh that's really cool can you
06:59 

06:59 try on something
07:00 

07:00 I have a question yeah because for
07:02 

07:02 Skittles it's quite obvious that it's
07:04 

07:04 unhealthy so what if it's something like
07:06 

07:06 in the middle like you're not so sure do
07:08 

07:08 you have something like more
07:10 

07:10 ambiguous y let me try do this work so
07:15 

07:15 now I actually have a 100 plus so I'm a
07:18 

07:18 100 plus fan I just love this I drink it
07:22 

07:22 as an energy drink and I think it's
07:24 

07:24 healthy so let's see what Chad GPD says
07:28 

07:28 it's here and I'll take a
07:33 

07:33 picture and it's it's still
07:39 

07:39 loading and it is okay actually and yeah
07:44 

07:44 it's low in calories zero fat and
07:46 

07:46 there's sodium in it I actually did not
07:49 

07:49 know that there was salt in this 100 BL
07:52 

07:52 well it has I think sodium is actually
07:54 

07:54 good for like energy drinks maybe that's
07:57 

07:57 why because you need to have sodium uh
07:60 

07:60 after you lose like so much sweat and
08:04 

08:04 everything yeah so it does it does say
08:06 

08:06 here that the sodium content is low
08:08 

08:08 making it a decent option for low sodium
08:11 

08:11 diet so I guess low sodium looking for
08:14 

08:14 low low salt there you go and it has
08:18 

08:18 potassium and calcium and while this
08:20 

08:20 drink is not nutrient dense it can be a
08:23 

08:23 part of a healthy diet if enjoyed
08:27 

08:27 occasionally occasionally so so this is
08:30 

08:30 what my app does and that's how it helps
08:34 

08:34 me oh that's pretty cool nice nice can
08:39 

08:39 can I try using mine like can it take a
08:40 

08:40 picture from my
08:43 

08:43 screen uh
08:45 

08:45 no but open this app on your end because
08:48 

08:48 it is hosted yeah yeah because she
08:50 

08:50 hosted it of herself so let me actually
08:54 

08:54 send you the link on
08:58 

08:58 Telegram and then and you should be able
09:01 

09:01 to also share your
09:04 

09:04 screen and try it out on your products
09:08 

09:08 so uh the interesting like while just
09:10 

09:10 setting it up the interesting thing
09:12 

09:12 about this is that it actually took me
09:14 

09:14 quite so the actual setup of the app
09:17 

09:17 itself was really simple right so I just
09:18 

09:18 had to make the make a react app and
09:23 

09:23 call open
09:24 

09:24 Ai and once I did
09:27 

09:27 that yeah open Ai and then put in like
09:30 

09:30 the environment keys and stuff and then
09:32 

09:32 the hard part was to actually get the
09:35 

09:35 content out the
09:37 

09:37 analysis the overall what mean shows up
09:40 

09:40 like why why is that the difficult
09:42 

09:42 part so I actually had to tell it what I
09:46 

09:46 want to know exactly like I want to know
09:48 

09:48 is it healthy or not and I want a lay
09:50 

09:50 person to understand it so there was a
09:53 

09:53 lot of back and for with me and CH yeah
09:56 

09:56 yeah and then when I finally got the
09:59 

09:59 prompt that want the response that I
10:01 

10:01 want and then I just asked from a Chad
10:04 

10:04 back can you give me this response in a
10:07 

10:07 prompt format so that I can use it in my
10:10 

10:10 app I literally said that and it gave me
10:13 

10:13 the prompt itself so GPD can actually
10:16 

10:16 give me the prompt so then I was like
10:19 

10:19 then why is everyone so upbeat about
10:21 

10:21 this it's just telling it to give you
10:23 

10:23 the prompt The Prompt engineer asking
10:26 

10:26 the the chat GPT to give the prompt and
10:30 

10:30 isn't it expensive though like for the
10:32 

10:32 tokens to I I was just gonna ask like
10:35 

10:35 per API call like how much is
10:37 

10:37 it so I I've yet to calculate it but
10:41 

10:41 it's not that expensive uh so I've
10:43 

10:43 actually sorry I've actually put up
10:45 

10:45 Victoria's screen on this so you can
10:48 

10:48 start your day we come back to the whole
10:49 

10:49 AP I think later but that's
10:53 

10:53 yeah oh you actually went to get
10:57 

10:57 something there you go oh actually this
11:00 

11:00 one is very very extensive the nutrition
11:04 

11:04 label yes try it on this you might have
11:06 

11:06 to scroll down on the website and click
11:08 

11:08 take a picture there's a button called
11:10 

11:10 take a picture yeah but it doesn't look
11:12 

11:12 so clear in the yeah you have to go a
11:15 

11:15 bit behind maybe back up one thing I do
11:19 

11:19 for open a right because you're actually
11:21 

11:21 sending this picture over to their
11:22 

11:22 servers try not to show your face yeah
11:25 

11:25 just for privacy reasons I don't think
11:28 

11:28 it's capturing it that way well because
11:30 

11:30 of your webcam or maybe if you have a
11:33 

11:33 have
11:36 

11:36 a CU actually this could be a this could
11:40 

11:40 be a good Edge
11:43 

11:43 case what if you send it a bad picture
11:46 

11:46 what does it actually say with the with
11:48 

11:48 the fixed prompt that I've sent to it
11:50 

11:50 okay should I try just taking a picture
11:53 

11:53 like this yeah yeah try it's not that
11:56 

11:56 expensive case testing let's go we love
12:01 

12:01 testing I love HK T watching it
12:06 

12:06 break Victoria's shirt is clearer
12:11 

12:11 than so it's gonna be like life I'm
12:14 

12:14 evaluating the nutrition of
12:17 

12:17 life so you know how like as developers
12:20 

12:20 we when we test our own apps we never
12:23 

12:23 break it I actually have not broken my
12:25 

12:25 app like broken in a sense like found a
12:27 

12:27 bug in my app so that's excited like you
12:30 

12:30 know what do this do this unclear thing
12:32 

12:32 and I want to see what the actually
12:34 

12:34 produces
12:37 

12:37 or also is it because Victoria you have
12:40 

12:40 the blur filter
12:42 

12:42 on
12:45 

12:45 maybe what's what's coming up on your
12:48 

12:48 terminalone on like the hosting uh I'll
12:52 

12:52 have to log in actually I'm not yet
12:56 

12:56 quite a bit should I try taking another
12:58 

12:58 picture
13:01 

13:01 Yeah by now it should have returned a
13:03 

13:03 response it's probably not it's probably
13:06 

13:06 not not that great because I was relying
13:10 

13:10 on
13:10 

13:10 the
13:13 

13:13 format so I've asked G to give me a
13:16 

13:16 fixed format response and I actually did
13:19 

13:19 not ask it to give any error if there is
13:22 

13:22 any that's a good idea I should I can
13:25 

13:25 actually add it yeah can just prompt it
13:28 

13:28 to say like oh eror handling for this
13:30 

13:30 specific era I just wonder what the era
13:32 

13:32 is right now because it's just like
13:34 

13:34 unlimited loading now yeah it's probably
13:37 

13:37 an error and if there's no response it
13:41 

13:41 would just show the loading okay so
13:43 

13:43 basically if you put in a picture that
13:45 

13:45 cannot be read you
13:49 

13:49 probably will run into an error and you
13:52 

13:52 haven't handled it
13:54 

13:54 ticket ticket J ticket or whatever
13:58 

13:58 platform would you be interested to look
13:60 

13:60 at my code sure I mean I have a lot of
14:04 

14:04 like like code questions but yeah I I I
14:07 

14:07 think it's supposed to work maybe if
14:09 

14:09 Victoria you TR use your phone instead
14:11 

14:11 maybe our webcams are just not that
14:14 

14:14 great is using her iPhone to record
14:19 

14:19 yeah Mac to Mac
14:22 

14:22 advantages so this would actually
14:25 

14:25 [Music]
14:27 

14:27 be here after the cameras
14:33 

14:33 did you also use or like co-pilot to
14:36 

14:36 spit up the
14:39 

14:39 app uh I got I use chib to create
14:43 

14:43 portions of it in whenever I did not
14:46 

14:46 know how to do it by by myself I think I
14:48 

14:48 broke your
14:50 

14:50 app you broke
14:53 

14:53 it I can't access it anymore oh oh dang
14:57 

14:57 you got to check versel deoy maybe the
14:59 

14:59 sell it got down I tried to reload this
15:03 

15:03 is what happens when when developers
15:06 

15:06 this is what happens when developers
15:07 

15:07 test the app I see no
15:11 

15:11 bug we're bug testers we're QA
15:15 

15:15 today okay so for you're using react uh
15:22 

15:22 yes oh nextjs is it nextjs or
15:25 

15:25 react uh
15:27 

15:27 nextjs react with next
15:30 

15:30 yes so yes I don't to explain all these
15:35 

15:35 like Stacks in this video I because like
15:37 

15:37 I know in our podcast we tend to try to
15:39 

15:39 explain the very technical Concepts but
15:43 

15:43 do we want to briefly explain react next
15:46 

15:46 year is that necessary you think maybe
15:48 

15:48 that's for a separate
15:50 

15:50 video separate video maybe we'll put
15:53 

15:53 like that I don't know yeah but okay our
15:57 

15:57 subscribers can tell us what did didn't
15:60 

15:60 understand in this video and we can see
16:03 

16:03 if we can answer it in the comments
16:04 

16:04 please leave your feedback below we
16:07 

16:07 don't know what kind of audiences would
16:08 

16:08 reach honestly like uh we're happy to
16:11 

16:11 explain all these things to non teches
16:13 

16:13 as well uh but right now we're just
16:15 

16:15 running off the top of our head um but
16:19 

16:19 yes actually even for people who don't
16:21 

16:21 know how to read code a lot of code is
16:23 

16:23 very literal like as you can see set is
16:27 

16:27 loading it's a function to be be able to
16:30 

16:30 set the loading State like just now when
16:33 

16:33 you saw the app and then you had the
16:34 

16:34 little circle thing like going on and on
16:38 

16:38 yeah so this function basically sets the
16:40 

16:40 loading
16:42 

16:42 State soone what what is like the key
16:46 

16:46 part of uh your app so far that you were
16:48 

16:48 quite proud of yourself about having
16:51 

16:51 implemented
16:52 

16:52 it um I think I think it was what I
16:56 

16:56 mentioned where I asked GPD to give me
16:59 

16:59 the prompt itself I think I was when I
17:02 

17:02 did that I I had this moment of
17:04 

17:04 Enlightenment that wait I can actually
17:08 

17:08 ask it to do even that I thought that
17:10 

17:10 was the most difficult part which was
17:12 

17:12 creating the prompt and then let me
17:14 

17:14 actually show
17:17 

17:17 you how did you prompt the The Prompt
17:21 

17:21 engine yeah
17:25 

17:25 prompt here it's
17:29 

17:29 this is very ugly but this is the text
17:32 

17:32 that I sent this is the prompt that I
17:34 

17:34 send it uh analyze the nutritional
17:37 

17:37 information so this is actually given to
17:39 

17:39 me by chat
17:42 

17:42 GPT so you ask chat GPT hey give me a
17:45 

17:45 prompt to be able to ask you about the
17:48 

17:48 nutritional information but in a
17:49 

17:49 consistent manner something like
17:52 

17:52 that yes like yeah I actually have some
17:56 

17:56 Snippets of me I actually like
17:57 

17:57 screenshoted me asking
18:00 

18:00 like after after I got the response that
18:03 

18:03 I wanted from it uh something like this
18:06 

18:06 the next question I asked it was can I
18:08 

18:08 get a query template of this response so
18:10 

18:10 that I can ask you for different
18:12 

18:12 nutrition effects imag can I get the
18:14 

18:14 query template I like
18:17 

18:17 that that's gave it to me template for a
18:21 

18:21 prompt oh there somebody I just copy
18:23 

18:23 pasted it I just copy pasted this into
18:26 

18:26 my app and voila
18:30 

18:30 was that
18:31 

18:31 easy so do you learn anything about like
18:34 

18:34 PR engineering from here like what is
18:37 

18:37 the good practice or what is like a good
18:40 

18:40 structure that makes it clear for chat
18:42 

18:42 jpt to execute your your questions your
18:45 

18:45 prompt not really actually I mean as I
18:48 

18:48 didn't I haven't done any formal study
18:50 

18:50 around prompt engineering itself I
18:53 

18:53 usually just ask it like I would to a
18:56 

18:56 person so as you can see I'm actually
18:58 

18:58 very nice to Chad I'm like can I please
19:01 

19:01 get something from you I that I thank
19:04 

19:04 you too I don't know why it's like the
19:07 

19:07 people it is very humanik though like
19:10 

19:10 absolutely here has a c template for you
19:13 

19:13 something like that right
19:14 

19:14 like oh thank you that you made my life
19:17 

19:17 so much
19:20 

19:20 easier yeah definitely you actually
19:22 

19:22 forget sometimes that it's actually a
19:24 

19:24 machine that I'm that you're talking to
19:26 

19:26 so oh you forget sometimes you're
19:29 

19:29 talking to machine I I do yeah actually
19:33 

19:33 app I actually did a lot of talking to
19:35 

19:35 it so then I actually did forget for a
19:37 

19:37 while that it's actually a machine
19:39 

19:39 talking a machine yeah I had a friend
19:41 

19:41 who was telling me that she was using
19:43 

19:43 this AI mental Wellness app that was
19:45 

19:45 basically acting as a counselor so yeah
19:49 

19:49 even like that kind of uh social aspect
19:53 

19:53 yeah AI is able to do it now but
19:56 

19:56 actually coming back to the question
19:57 

19:57 like how much was it like per API call
20:00 

20:00 so again for viewers who are in like
20:02 

20:02 teches every time you send like a
20:06 

20:06 request like a question in this case to
20:09 

20:09 a a third party uh uh app in this case
20:12 

20:12 open AI is that third party app um
20:15 

20:15 sometimes they do charge you per request
20:18 

20:18 so in this case I I know that uh open AI
20:21 

20:21 CH GPT has some kind of pricing
20:23 

20:23 structure even though chat is free did
20:26 

20:26 you have to
20:27 

20:27 pay yes I had to B out actually quite
20:30 

20:30 surprised that there isn't a free option
20:32 

20:32 for developers you like usually apis for
20:36 

20:36 developers are free to like you know
20:37 

20:37 test it out and things like that but it
20:41 

20:41 it wasn't the case for this and so this
20:45 

20:45 is actually the cost okay so how it
20:49 

20:49 works is like at first you just have to
20:51 

20:51 top up like uh an amount of money to
20:54 

20:54 this open AI
20:56 

20:56 platform and I did $10 to to test it out
20:60 

20:60 oh and then I just started using it so
21:03 

21:03 it was actually like
21:05 

21:05 0.001 Cent for I don't know I have to
21:11 

21:11 calculate 18 cents was I just I
21:17 

21:17 38 38 requests for 18 cents that's okay
21:21 

21:21 okay because you fantastic all one user
21:23 

21:23 yourself until Victoria came along yeah
21:25 

21:25 so that would be
21:29 

21:29 and broke it yes so that's actually
21:33 

21:33 0.005 cents per
21:36 

21:36 call and uh so while it's very cheap I
21:42 

21:42 would say uh but like one thing that I
21:44 

21:44 realized is that so it works with this
21:46 

21:46 thing called tokens right and I think it
21:50 

21:50 even the size of your prompt matters
21:54 

21:54 here so if you send a whole long prompt
21:58 

21:58 it will cost do more if you can make it
22:00 

22:00 summarized in the shorter prompt it will
22:03 

22:03 be cheaper for you and of course sending
22:05 

22:05 image is another
22:07 

22:07 cost in this case you you have to send
22:10 

22:10 an image right yeah in this case I have
22:12 

22:12 to send the image it's not like logging
22:15 

22:15 the image
22:17 

22:17 cost I don't think it breaks it down and
22:20 

22:20 tells us what it
22:24 

22:24 is I think I saw reest image request is
22:28 

22:28 it
22:31 

22:31 yeah oh no I think this is the response
22:34 

22:34 image like it it is not returning me the
22:37 

22:37 image yeah yeah oh I see I see okay okay
22:40 

22:40 I think so that that's why zero I would
22:43 

22:43 think so T to speech yeah yeah okay okay
22:49 

22:49 okay so it's it's not that expensive but
22:51 

22:51 at the same time yeah you're right like
22:52 

22:52 with a lot of like apis at least if
22:55 

22:55 you're in the uh testing stage they
22:58 

22:58 usually give it to you for free just so
23:01 

23:01 because as like developers you're always
23:03 

23:03 like prototyping and testing um
23:06 

23:06 extensively and then if you're spending
23:09 

23:09 so much money on every single API
23:11 

23:11 request when it's not even in production
23:13 

23:13 and life it's kind of painful to go
23:17 

23:17 through an extensive testing process so
23:20 

23:20 I'm just kind of like bummed with that
23:23 

23:23 but at the same time people are paying
23:25 

23:25 for it so I guess the business model
23:27 

23:27 works for them but I don't know if this
23:30 

23:30 works well for like more I don't know
23:33 

23:33 open-ended development and encouraging
23:35 

23:35 people to test their apps more
23:38 

23:38 thoroughly because you'll be a bit like
23:40 

23:40 oh but if I try and put it through this
23:43 

23:43 testing cycle like let's say if e2e to
23:45 

23:45 some extent and every time you push that
23:47 

23:47 deployment it's going to run the whole
23:49 

23:49 E2 process then you'll be spending so
23:51 

23:51 much after a while yeah I can imagine it
23:54 

23:54 will accumulate over time yeah yeah yeah
23:57 

23:57 thanks so much for sharing the project
23:59 

23:59 Salone I think it's a really cool
24:01 

24:01 project and definitely how the way you
24:03 

24:03 come out with it is it's like relevant
24:04 

24:04 to your own use case so it's nice to see
24:07 

24:07 basically you building just out of like
24:09 

24:09 a problem you want to solve yourself
24:11 

24:11 that's so cool yeah yeah that's why we
24:13 

24:13 program that's why we buildt
24:15 

24:15 stuff to make our life sowhat easier are
24:20 

24:20 you intending to add more features like
24:22 

24:22 what what's your uh end State for the
24:24 

24:24 app or you just like I just want to do
24:25 

24:25 this for
24:26 

24:26 fun I was actually just doing it for fun
24:29 

24:29 but actually so uh like one one thing
24:33 

24:33 that I realized while doing this was
24:35 

24:35 that actually why would anyone use my
24:37 

24:37 app they can just use it for themselves
24:39 

24:39 on chat gbt right like who's stopping
24:42 

24:42 you from doing it right now on chat gbt
24:44 

24:44 itself like upload the image and so the
24:47 

24:47 only thing is the The Prompt it took me
24:50 

24:50 some time to make the prompt to be able
24:52 

24:52 to to tell me exactly what it is it will
24:54 

24:54 take you like maybe 10 minutes to now
24:58 

24:58 for yourself so that's the value
25:01 

25:01 proposition here the prompt interesting
25:04 

25:04 I never thought about it that prompt
25:06 

25:06 that the way the time that you spend
25:08 

25:08 doing the prompt engineering becomes the
25:11 

25:11 Val proposition I always was very
25:13 

25:13 skeptical of the term prompt engineer
25:14 

25:14 when it came out but you've basically
25:16 

25:16 proven that oh it's actually quite like
25:21 

25:21 value adding um uh skill set yeah I was
25:24 

25:24 actually yeah of the same belief I also
25:26 

25:26 didn't understand exactly what's this
25:28 

25:28 prompt engineering everyone's talking
25:29 

25:29 about but then here it comes when I
25:31 

25:31 actually started this app I'm like I see
25:34 

25:34 now that why would why would people be
25:37 

25:37 like so into this prompt engineering
25:40 

25:40 it's a whole skill in itself that's true
25:42 

25:42 I mean in a way uh in in an Inception
25:46 

25:46 sort of way it's sort of like what we do
25:47 

25:47 right um people T it to us because we
25:50 

25:50 can ask questions in a certain way to
25:52 

25:52 prompt people in a certain way I guess
25:55 

25:55 so it is a skill right people hopefully
25:58 

25:58 tune in because of that so I guess this
26:01 

26:01 way yeah but this one is prompting a
26:03 

26:03 machine not a human yeah so make the
26:07 

26:07 prompt
26:08 

26:08 better oh yeah sorry as a future thing
26:12 

26:12 make the prompt
26:13 

26:13 better and if you want to sa money for
26:16 

26:16 the API request I was thinking maybe you
26:18 

26:18 can add some like memory storage so you
26:20 

26:20 can save like previous prompts then you
26:23 

26:23 know if you look up the same food item
26:26 

26:26 they already you have already stored
26:27 

26:27 like
26:29 

26:29 cash it yeah you can cash it so that way
26:32 

26:32 you're not calling again for the same
26:34 

26:34 label nutrition label yeah yeah of
26:36 

26:36 course there's a cost benefit if like
26:38 

26:38 cashing it and I don't know if you want
26:39 

26:39 to do a Reddit store Reddit is very
26:41 

26:41 expensive itself so if and also it has
26:44 

26:44 to do image to image uh matching like is
26:47 

26:47 this image the same as another image
26:49 

26:49 people different angle images
26:51 

26:51 [Music]
26:53 

26:53 right that would be to figure
26:56 

26:56 out solution
26:60 

26:60 I was actually asking uh Victoria for
27:03 

27:03 help in this where how can I earn money
27:05 

27:05 from this like if I do put it out there
27:07 

27:07 for people to
27:09 

27:09 use many people would start using it
27:11 

27:11 then actually my $10 would start de
27:13 

27:13 beating very fast and Victor offered
27:16 

27:16 like solution of like adding
27:18 

27:18 ads just so
27:20 

27:20 randomly maybe ads would come
27:22 

27:22 up and that's
27:25 

27:25 that's yeah at the time I was thinking
27:27 

27:27 because I thought it was a mobile app so
27:29 

27:29 if it's a mobile app ads is always like
27:32 

27:32 an easy way it just doesn't have to be
27:34 

27:34 so intrusive kind of ads it can be like
27:36 

27:36 those little popup banner ads that you
27:38 

27:38 can put in that will pop up sometime and
27:40 

27:40 then you can always click the close
27:42 

27:42 button then it wouldn't like intrusive
27:44 

27:44 it's not that intrusive or I was
27:47 

27:47 thinking it goes very well in line with
27:49 

27:49 like do you guys know Health 365 in
27:55 

27:55 Singapore oh where's my camera
27:58 

27:58 365 oh wait this one yeah and then uh
28:03 

28:03 basically it's a government uh funded uh
28:07 

28:07 app to be you know to keep people
28:09 

28:09 healthy but they already have like a
28:10 

28:10 scan function not for nutrition but to
28:13 

28:13 scan receipts where you go to the
28:15 

28:15 grocery store and you buy something
28:17 

28:17 healthy it out and stuff this could be
28:20 

28:20 your exit strategy maybe you can like
28:22 

28:22 pitch to them maybe they'll buy you over
28:25 

28:25 yeah yeah quick quick entry quick exit
28:29 

28:29 yeah and all they're buying is my
28:32 

28:32 prompt actually think about it they're
28:34 

28:34 just buying your
28:37 

28:37 prompt learn something
28:40 

28:40 new yeah maybe after this can try we can
28:44 

28:44 hear more about your prompt engineering
28:46 

28:46 Adventures maybe you can tweak it make
28:49 

28:49 it more clear or even you know display
28:52 

28:52 the results in a very easy to read way
28:54 

28:54 instead of like just a whole string as a
28:56 

28:56 paragraph and then maybe a good pitch
28:59 

28:59 for health
29:01 

29:01 365 Health 365 yeah what's about like
29:05 

29:05 health related app if you want that to
29:06 

29:06 be exit strategy but the ad seemed like
29:08 

29:08 a more straightforward idea just yeah if
29:12 

29:12 you wanted to be stand yeah we're just
29:15 

29:15 throwing things out like yeah but we
29:17 

29:17 just want to see you make it we want to
29:19 

29:19 see you make it yeah yeah but you you
29:21 

29:21 you went to it not so much to making
29:23 

29:23 money but just like to have fun with it
29:26 

29:26 yeah I want to try it out like what what
29:27 

29:27 is all this hype about with open Ai and
29:31 

29:31 what exactly is this
29:33 

29:33 prompting I I got I I see it now but
29:40 

29:40 yeah yeah you can call yourself a prompt
29:43 

29:43 engineer
29:45 

29:45 now I I'll actually I will spend some
29:48 

29:48 time uh learning about promp engineering
29:50 

29:50 to see maybe like there are strategies
29:53 

29:53 out there to make prom thing better
29:56 

29:56 maybe so if that's the case why not I
29:58 

29:58 I'll be up for it to learn more yeah
30:03 

30:03 yeah
30:04 

30:04 yeah thanks to you I'm also now
30:06 

30:06 interested now I'm also curious about
30:08 

30:08 prompt engineering and maybe sometime
30:10 

30:10 I'll like check it out and try my
30:12 

30:12 own try yeah I will look forward to a
30:16 

30:16 Blog article from you my journey trying
30:19 

30:19 out being a prompt engineer
30:22 

30:22 engineer actually all all prompt
30:25 

30:25 engineering is is communication with a
30:29 

30:29 machine I love it I love the way you put
30:32 

30:32 it communication with a machine that's
30:35 

30:35 great so so basically when you learn
30:37 

30:37 prompt engine you're just learning how
30:38 

30:38 to talk to a
30:39 

30:39 machine it's just like a like a
30:42 

30:42 communication is a university course
30:46 

30:46 pump
30:48 

30:48 engineering
30:50 

30:50 machines that's very true and in fact
30:52 

30:52 it's probably a little bit more
30:54 

30:54 straightforward sometimes it's just that
30:55 

30:55 you need to feed it context that's the
30:57 

30:57 main difference
30:59 

30:59 like communicating with humans verus
31:00 

31:00 communicating with machines like um
31:03 

31:03 machines don't have contact and that's
31:05 

31:05 why you have to feed it to them and so
31:07 

31:07 the whole Pro thing
31:10 

31:10 forth actually I I would think it's not
31:13 

31:13 that different to talking to humans I I
31:17 

31:17 mean did make mistakes like a human and
31:19 

31:19 then I did correct it as I would like to
31:22 

31:22 maybe like a junior developer or
31:26 

31:26 something so yeah
31:28 

31:28 I'm actually quite curious about this
31:30 

31:30 space
31:31 

31:31 exactly is so different what why why are
31:34 

31:34 people making such a big deal about this
31:37 

31:37 like like specifically propt engineering
31:40 

31:40 yeah yeah well you maybe less skeptical
31:43 

31:43 and want to like explore it more maybe
31:45 

31:45 we'll explore it in like a a actual
31:47 

31:47 full-blown episode after this see if can
31:50 

31:50 get some experts in a fi I really want
31:53 

31:53 to see if there's a person whose job
31:55 

31:55 title is prompt engineer
31:58 

31:58 like it's is there such a
32:01 

32:01 thing I think there there was I've seen
32:04 

32:04 it right that's how we
32:07 

32:07 got Google it okay also anybody in
32:11 

32:11 audience if you happen to be a prompt
32:12 

32:12 engineer and you're based in Singapore
32:15 

32:15 um hit us up we would like to ask you
32:17 

32:17 some questions we want to prompt The
32:19 

32:19 Prompt
32:20 

32:20 engineer oh yes we I prompt Engineers
32:24 

32:24 earn 300K salaries
32:28 

32:28 this is import yeah so it's a real job
32:33 

32:33 oh yes oh yes very interesting okay
32:36 

32:36 there is even even in Singapore there is
32:39 

32:39 a prompt engineer opening at Sleek this
32:43 

32:43 company called Sleek Evolution Singapore
32:47 

32:47 Raa AI I guess basically to do this
32:50 

32:50 exactly what I just did but maybe bit
32:52 

32:52 more strategies in place yeah I'm sure
32:56 

32:56 there's a strategy around that like you
32:59 

32:59 know when you you ask like can I have a
33:02 

33:02 query template for I just thought that
33:04 

33:04 oh that's an interesting strategy of
33:05 

33:05 asking so I'm sure somebody already like
33:08 

33:08 has like a whole list of different
33:10 

33:10 strategies to PR depending on what
33:12 

33:12 you're trying to get out of it and here
33:14 

33:14 is
33:15 

33:15 AWS uh definition of prompt engineering
33:19 

33:19 so from AWS prompt engineering makes it
33:21 

33:21 easy for users to obtain relevant
33:23 

33:23 results in the first prompt so that's
33:26 

33:26 what
33:28 

33:28 prom I got it like after seven
33:31 

33:31 prompts why you engineered and then now
33:33 

33:33 you perfect prompt for your nutrition
33:36 

33:36 and then I put the the perfect promp
33:38 

33:38 yeah exactly that's what I did exactly
33:41 

33:41 so you have prompt engineer prom yeah
33:44 

33:44 can we put a crown on Salon like
33:47 

33:47 prompt okay is there anything on stream
33:49 

33:49 yet no okay
33:51 

33:51 [Music]
33:52 

33:52 but yeah this is fun let's do this kind
33:55 

33:55 of episodes again actually
33:58 

33:58 yeah yeah like see each other's apps
34:01 

34:01 yeah well I think it's time it's a good
34:02 

34:02 time to just kind of wrap up I think
34:05 

34:05 we've kind of explored quite a few
34:06 

34:06 topics even like just through this very
34:08 

34:08 short um sharing session uh I think we
34:12 

34:12 might do it again uh because this was
34:15 

34:15 actually surprisingly fun and
34:17 

34:17 insightful um but again like audience
34:19 

34:19 members put it down in the comments
34:21 

34:21 below how you think like the format of
34:23 

34:23 this can be improved what you think
34:25 

34:25 about prompt engineering what do you
34:26 

34:26 think about salon's food AI app would
34:28 

34:28 you pay for it would you buy it do you
34:30 

34:30 have any pricing strategies for us um or
34:33 

34:33 you do you want to try using it do you
34:35 

34:35 want to try breaking it like
34:37 

34:37 Victoria can sign up to be a QA tester
34:39 

34:39 but yeah as always this was a rack tag
34:43
