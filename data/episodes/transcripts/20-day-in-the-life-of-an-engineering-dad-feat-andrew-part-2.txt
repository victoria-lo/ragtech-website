00:00 hi everyone welcome to R teag the place
00:02 

00:02 for bites and ventor my name is Victoria
00:04 

00:04 I'm a Solutions engineer I'm Salon
00:06 

00:06 software developer and today we have our
00:09 

00:09 guest Andrew hey everyone my name is
00:11 

00:11 Andrew and I'm a senior software
00:13 

00:13 engineer at a fintech company and
00:16 

00:16 recently I've been become a new dad to
00:19 

00:19 um one and a half year old son yeah
00:21 

00:21 which is such a great segue to our topic
00:24 

00:24 for today because today is all about the
00:26 

00:26 engineering dad and basically we just
00:29 

00:29 want to dive deep into the life of
00:31 

00:31 Andrew like not too
00:34 

00:34 deep just dive deep about like how has
00:37 

00:37 he basically managed his time like both
00:39 

00:39 as a software engineer and as a recent
00:42 

00:42 dad so I think we can ask our first
00:45 

00:45 question that we're most curious about
00:46 

00:46 for Andrew is what does a typical day
00:48 

00:48 look like for you balancing just as a
00:51 

00:51 software engineer and as a dad the day
00:54 

00:54 in the life of being a dad and and junor
00:57 

00:57 I think it's it was quite hectic last
00:59 

00:59 year because firstly like for example
01:02 

01:02 our in the morning we have to kind of
01:06 

01:06 give him milk and change his diapers and
01:10 

01:10 also change his clothes and stuff like
01:12 

01:12 that basically this is another human
01:14 

01:14 being right so he would have to eat
01:16 

01:16 sleep shower change clothes just that
01:20 

01:20 someone else have to do it for him now
01:22 

01:22 because he's not capable of doing so
01:24 

01:24 yeah so the morning it's usually quite
01:26 

01:26 hectic in that sense because I have to
01:28 

01:28 also get ready for uh for stand up it's
01:31 

01:31 always a rush to kind of get everything
01:35 

01:35 that needs to be done for my son in the
01:36 

01:36 morning we have to feed him like every
01:39 

01:39 two or three hours as well so you
01:41 

01:41 constantly have to kind of be reminded
01:42 

01:42 all this like when is his next nap time
01:45 

01:45 when is next feeling time have we
01:47 

01:47 changed typers so a lot of like asking
01:49 

01:49 ourselves like me and my wife asking
01:51 

01:51 ourselves questions throughout the day
01:53 

01:53 is it time yet is it time yet and and
01:55 

01:55 like while still trying to qu something
01:57 

01:57 out right so it's it's kind of at a
01:59 

01:59 backround mind that I have another
02:01 

02:01 person to take care of I think
02:03 

02:03 throughout the throughout the like 9 to
02:05 

02:05 5 or 9 to six we'll just be juggling
02:07 

02:07 between going for meetings and like when
02:11 

02:11 I when I end work and I basically become
02:13 

02:13 more fulltime with my son we have to
02:16 

02:16 stop preparing like his for night yeah
02:18 

02:18 for night time it's like there a
02:20 

02:20 different set of things to do like we
02:22 

02:22 shower him or like bring him up for walk
02:25 

02:25 and also try try to get into a schedule
02:28 

02:28 I think more recently there's updated
02:31 

02:31 version because we we got we actually
02:34 

02:34 employ the helper and she actually helps
02:37 

02:37 with the the morning routine so me and
02:41 

02:41 my wife can actually sleep in a bit
02:42 

02:42 longer um yeah I think that's the two
02:45 

02:45 versions that I have as of now um as of
02:50 

02:50 now cuz is I say as of now because it's
02:52 

02:52 always going to change like every I
02:55 

02:55 wouldn't say every year like every month
02:57 

02:57 every month is is a different every not
02:60 

02:60 every month new version update yeah new
03:02 

03:02 it's like a like a minor version bump
03:05 

03:05 minor version bu wow yeah so just
03:08 

03:08 hearing from you it's like very hectic
03:10 

03:10 constantly changing constantly having to
03:13 

03:13 adapt I was wondering if there's any
03:14 

03:14 technology that you use to leverage or
03:16 

03:16 to help you like navigate all these like
03:19 

03:19 new responsibilities especially since
03:21 

03:21 you're software engineer do you like
03:23 

03:23 dabble and like making an app or like
03:25 

03:25 finding apps that will help with that
03:28 

03:28 I yeah wouldn't the thing is I wouldn't
03:32 

03:32 I wouldn't even have the time to to have
03:35 

03:35 uh looked into having an app or like
03:39 

03:39 creating something on my own there's no
03:41 

03:41 need to reinvent we there really apps
03:43 

03:43 baby apps out there that can kind of
03:45 

03:45 help me and my wife we didn't actually
03:48 

03:48 get a baby monitor per se the thing that
03:51 

03:51 we we use is
03:52 

03:52 just uh just to track like the live
03:55 

03:55 footage and also it allows you to store
03:58 

03:58 like to the cloud mhm but we didn't do
04:00 

04:00 that cuz we thought it was like too much
04:03 

04:03 we just like back it up to the local SD
04:06 

04:06 card on the camera so we can through the
04:09 

04:09 app we can do like a playback we can
04:11 

04:11 just go the parts of the night and see
04:13 

04:13 what what he was doing cuz sometimes you
04:14 

04:14 wake up in the middle of night and uh oh
04:18 

04:18 yeah it's all by themselves right just
04:20 

04:20 their yeah and then they might just sit
04:22 

04:22 down and like just look into the end
04:25 

04:25 like they might go to sleep or not um we
04:28 

04:28 we not only have such cameras in his
04:31 

04:31 bedroom but also we have it in like
04:32 

04:32 living room it also helped capture some
04:34 

04:34 of the moments that we weren't able to
04:37 

04:37 capture like for example when he was
04:39 

04:39 like first started
04:40 

04:40 clapping uh it's not like it's not like
04:43 

04:43 you it's not like me and my wife has our
04:45 

04:45 food always standby right so the thing
04:47 

04:47 is always recording so we just need to
04:49 

04:49 go back play back at that exact second
04:52 

04:52 it allows us to capture like a snippet
04:54 

04:54 and then oh that's nice the person he
04:57 

04:57 stands also I guess Yeahs yeah like as
05:01 

05:01 long as it's within the view of the
05:02 

05:02 camera cuz we don't have like camera
05:04 

05:04 everywhere so it's just like in the main
05:07 

05:07 spaces whereby he usually at I actually
05:09 

05:09 wanted to ask like with this uh dad
05:12 

05:12 being a dad and a Sofer you how do you
05:14 

05:14 actually like at least for me I find it
05:16 

05:16 I it will be a bit difficult for me to
05:19 

05:19 stop thinking about one or the other do
05:21 

05:21 you face this issue where you can't
05:24 

05:24 separate uh your thought process maybe I
05:28 

05:28 would say definitely because
05:30 

05:30 our like me and my
05:32 

05:32 wives well we live we live in the Tre
05:34 

05:34 room hdb so it's not the biggest so it
05:38 

05:38 doesn't really matter if you have the
05:39 

05:39 door closed or like you can still hear
05:42 

05:42 yeah we can still hear or even sometimes
05:44 

05:44 like
05:45 

05:45 weas think that he's crying but she's
05:48 

05:48 not it's like this kind of like
05:49 

05:49 hallucinations no because it's just like
05:52 

05:52 espe time so you might think it's is it
05:55 

05:55 crying I mean especially during like the
05:57 

05:57 first year where he's where he's like
05:59 

05:59 you can't even walk C yet like he's just
06:02 

06:02 mainly just uh crying when he when he's
06:05 

06:05 hungry like I mean that's the way that
06:07 

06:07 they communicate in the early years yeah
06:09 

06:09 I would say it's hard
06:11 

06:11 to contact switch I mean even at work
06:14 

06:14 even at work there is contact switching
06:16 

06:16 I think the boundaries between work and
06:19 

06:19 being a that have as much as possible
06:21 

06:21 you want to be like a super human right
06:23 

06:23 but I think eventually it's just going
06:25 

06:25 to be really tiring to manage both yeah
06:27 

06:27 you just have to manage one thing at a
06:29 

06:29 time and like on the weekends where
06:31 

06:31 there obviously there's no work and like
06:33 

06:33 you have full commitment to to taking
06:35 

06:35 care of your kid I think that's that's
06:38 

06:38 important to have yeah I do have one uh
06:41 

06:41 question for you uh like I always want
06:43 

06:43 to ask this to like a man where you know
06:47 

06:47 like how we always associate children
06:50 

06:50 and kids with moms like the mom has to
06:52 

06:52 be very involved with the child but I
06:55 

06:55 I've heard that you're a little bit more
06:57 

06:57 Hands-On you you actually uh ask a
06:59 

06:59 company for like oh can I get some time
07:01 

07:01 off here I need to bring my child to
07:03 

07:03 Clinic I need to take care of him I need
07:04 

07:04 to feed him so how do you feel it is
07:06 

07:06 like like do you think it's actually
07:08 

07:08 more mom involved or do you think Dad
07:10 

07:10 can have equal role in it or or that's
07:13 

07:13 how it should be like what's your take
07:15 

07:15 on it I believe it should be an equal
07:18 

07:18 involvement it has to be a two-way
07:20 

07:20 communication so in terms of having a
07:22 

07:22 kid maybe it's a bit different for dads
07:25 

07:25 Because I think there's a saying out
07:26 

07:26 there that goes like a mom becomes a mom
07:29 

07:29 when when they get pregnant because then
07:31 

07:31 they have to carry the kid for 9 months
07:34 

07:34 and then um it already affected their
07:37 

07:37 life yeah really affected their lives in
07:39 

07:39 terms of how they're feeling right for
07:41 

07:41 the N9 months but a dead comes a dead
07:44 

07:44 when the kid is born like even that even
07:46 

07:46 at work I feel like being Hands-On is is
07:48 

07:48 something that when I say Hands-On I
07:50 

07:50 mean like be proactive right so I think
07:52 

07:52 not only just applies to like having a
07:54 

07:54 kid but like in any even in your job I
07:56 

07:56 being Hands-On there's always there's
07:57 

07:57 definitely always more upsides and
07:59 

07:59 downsides and there's no there's no harm
08:01 

08:01 like trying something they've not tried
08:02 

08:02 before and when it comes to taking care
08:04 

08:04 of a a baby things new things like
08:07 

08:07 unforeseen that com sens like when you
08:09 

08:09 changing the diapers and then like the
08:11 

08:11 kids earning the speed on you right and
08:12 

08:12 what what you do right it's like you
08:14 

08:14 will never you will never experience all
08:17 

08:17 of this if you don't even attempt to
08:20 

08:20 change uh the kids diapers right and we
08:23 

08:23 we actually employed the confinement n
08:26 

08:26 in the first month which basically do
08:28 

08:28 all the stuff while the mom while the
08:31 

08:31 mom rest but then that got me thinking
08:34 

08:34 because thankly the de doesn't really do
08:37 

08:37 much in the the whole labor process
08:39 

08:39 right just like moral support so
08:43 

08:43 like technically the de can just get
08:45 

08:45 started right away even even if there
08:47 

08:47 confirming any he can be hands on right
08:49 

08:49 from then right yeah I would say be
08:52 

08:52 hands on from the start and then I think
08:54 

08:54 eventually you just get like used to it
08:57 

08:57 and like just becomes part of your your
08:59 

08:59 daily routine
08:60 

08:60 it's good that he's like that you're
09:01 

09:01 very involved and that you really try to
09:04 

09:04 be empathetic towards you know like
09:06 

09:06 shared responsibilities and everything
09:08 

09:08 so maybe we can have one last question
09:11 

09:11 before wrapping up is that what advice
09:13 

09:13 can you give to like maybe future dads
09:17 

09:17 who are also engineers and have to like
09:19 

09:19 juggle and experience all this that you
09:21 

09:21 have experienced I would say because
09:23 

09:23 when you're a software engineer I think
09:25 

09:25 at least for most guys we try to
09:28 

09:28 tackle we try tackle challenges in a
09:31 

09:31 logical manner but sometimes there is no
09:34 

09:34 logic to to taking care of kid because
09:37 

09:37 you don't know I you don't know what
09:38 

09:38 they want right like if you are at work
09:42 

09:42 and you are working on debuging a
09:45 

09:45 specific issue it's always like pretty
09:48 

09:48 method methodical right you go step by
09:50 

09:50 step like check the logs and like try to
09:52 

09:52 reproduce the issue but with a kid you
09:55 

09:55 can't you can't reproduce the issue
09:56 

09:56 right it's just it's just really there
09:58 

09:58 and like even if you go through the
10:00 

10:00 things that you think it usually solves
10:02 

10:02 the issue like it still doesn't work
10:03 

10:03 then you just have to you just have to
10:05 

10:05 figure out like what what works best for
10:07 

10:07 because I think every every kid is
10:09 

10:09 different prepare yourself like to to
10:11 

10:11 that it's not always going it's not
10:13 

10:13 always going to work basically like in
10:15 

10:15 in in software engineering like there is
10:17 

10:17 definitely a solution to it but in
10:19 

10:19 taking when taking care of a kid like
10:21 

10:21 it's pretty normal right you just have
10:23 

10:23 to accept that it's it's a normal part
10:25 

10:25 of being a parent and you will only get
10:28 

10:28 better with time I think with being a
10:31 

10:31 dad and an engineer as well time
10:34 

10:34 management probably is important um
10:37 

10:37 because I mean at work you have
10:39 

10:39 different tasks to work on and as a dad
10:40 

10:40 you have different tasks to work on
10:42 

10:42 right so you kind of have to allocate
10:45 

10:45 your time accordingly and also like
10:47 

10:47 don't try to do everything by yourself
10:50 

10:50 at home you have to communicate with
10:53 

10:53 your wife and see which things you are
10:56 

10:56 better in and which things she's better
10:58 

10:58 in right U like for example I'm better
10:60 

10:60 at showering the kid and I'll just do it
11:02 

11:02 and she but she's better at like maybe
11:04 

11:04 cooking his food or like thinking of
11:06 

11:06 what food to in to him then she'll just
11:08 

11:08 take ownership of that so it's kind of
11:10 

11:10 the same at work as well in that sense
11:13 

11:13 cuz you just have to identify your
11:14 

11:14 strengths and and just work together
11:17 

11:17 with your your teammate in this case my
11:20 

11:20 wife and achieve your I want say achieve
11:23 

11:23 your goals but that's more for your work
11:25 

11:25 but like B see just grow old together
11:30 

11:30 with the with your sunmate like just
11:32 

11:32 watching maintain the code base well and
11:34 

11:34 then you know any up project actually
11:38 

11:38 the child will become something he'll
11:40 

11:40 have outcome also you have to constantly
11:42 

11:42 update nurturing it what's there
11:45 

11:45 together as a team yeah as a team yeah
11:47 

11:47 as a teamwork I like that I like how you
11:50 

11:50 always um have that parallelism and that
11:53 

11:53 it's always like that with software
11:54 

11:54 Engineers I I try I try not to overdo it
11:57 

11:57 but like on hindsight it does Mak sense
11:60 

11:60 some of things yeah it makes certain
12:02 

12:02 things metod
12:04 

12:04 meod yeah that's nice yeah so thank you
12:07 

12:07 so much Andrew for today's session I
12:09 

12:09 think once again we learned a lot
12:11 

12:11 especially compared to human's mom
12:13 

12:13 Junior episode now we learn a different
12:15 

12:15 perspective from the dad's perspective
12:17 

12:17 which is also just as interesting and
12:19 

12:19 just as insightful we hope a lot of
12:21 

12:21 people do find some relatability in this
12:24 

12:24 and maybe even take away a lot of advice
12:27 

12:27 for like aspiring new dads so thank you
12:29 

12:29 so much and yeah this has been R tag and
