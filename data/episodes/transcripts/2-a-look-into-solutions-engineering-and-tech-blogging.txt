00:00 okay one two
00:04 

00:04 three okay we're going to start
00:08 

00:08 [Music]
00:12 

00:12 now hi everybody Welcome to rag Tech I'm
00:15 

00:15 Natasha a software engineer I'm Saloni a
00:17 

00:17 software engineer as well and I'm
00:19 

00:19 Victoria a Solutions engineer and
00:21 

00:21 together we are reag so uh today's
00:24 

00:24 episode we will be talking all about
00:26 

00:26 Victoria uh we'll be asking her about
00:28 

00:28 questions about her work as a solution
00:30 

00:30 engineer as well as her psychic as a
00:33 

00:33 technical blogger and all the other
00:34 

00:34 stuff that Saloni and I have been really
00:37 

00:37 wondering about like despite knowing
00:38 

00:38 Victoria for so long so yeah that's
00:41 

00:41 going to be today's episode so I'm going
00:43 

00:43 to start off first with my question that
00:45 

00:45 I've always wanted to ask it's a bit of
00:47 

00:47 a stupid question actually but what is
00:49 

00:49 the solutions engineer yeah so I knew
00:53 

00:53 that you guys are going to ask this just
00:55 

00:55 like with many people they also ask me
00:57 

00:57 what exactly does the solutions engineer
00:59 

00:59 do so I do have like a copy paste
01:02 

01:02 thing uh let me find it how many people
01:06 

01:06 did you copy paste this to uh a few
01:08 

01:08 about 10 people so I have like let me
01:12 

01:12 look at the most recent chat that's how
01:14 

01:14 many people ask her what a Solutions
01:17 

01:17 yeah because like I know what a
01:18 

01:18 Solutions architect does I I know what a
01:20 

01:20 software engineer does so I'm always
01:22 

01:22 like is the solutions engineer like the
01:24 

01:24 combination of both Yeah so basically a
01:27 

01:27 Solutions engineer like tldr it's a
01:29 

01:29 client facing engineer so what we do is
01:32 

01:32 we collaborate with our sales colleagues
01:35 

01:35 to basically present technical
01:36 

01:36 presentations to our clients and it's
01:39 

01:39 basically we're trying to sell our
01:41 

01:41 products to them so for Enterprise level
01:44 

01:44 kind of products it's like those stuff
01:46 

01:46 that you don't often see you know
01:48 

01:48 consumer kind of facing products it's
01:50 

01:50 like really B2B oh just B2B yeah so
01:53 

01:53 usually we need to you know provide some
01:55 

01:55 presentations Technical Solutions also
01:58 

01:58 understanding the clients Arch Tech like
02:01 

02:01 technical requirements and like their
02:03 

02:03 tax stack and everything so that's why
02:05 

02:05 we would have like meetings to actually
02:07 

02:07 get to know like what they want find out
02:10 

02:10 their business needs and make sure that
02:11 

02:11 business needs can um kind of fit with
02:15 

02:15 the technical requirements right so we
02:18 

02:18 provide Solutions so we engineer
02:20 

02:20 Solutions Solutions engineer um in order
02:24 

02:24 to uh give them that so on the other
02:27 

02:27 side we also work internally so like we
02:29 

02:29 also talk to the product team like in
02:31 

02:31 the event our clients give us any
02:33 

02:33 feedback on the product they want things
02:35 

02:35 changed we can or updated we can
02:38 

02:38 actually communicated that uh across to
02:41 

02:41 our internal teams yeah and finally we
02:44 

02:44 also test the products so like any
02:45 

02:45 products in beta or like going to go ga
02:48 

02:48 we're going to like test it out for the
02:50 

02:50 merchants make sure that everything what
02:52 

02:52 G again uh General availability General
02:55 

02:55 availability yeah I thought General
02:57 

02:57 Assembly yeah I thought it was General
02:59 

02:59 Assembly wait what's General
03:01 

03:01 availability like so basically it's out
03:03 

03:03 for the public for like every country so
03:06 

03:06 I work in the payments industry so you
03:07 

03:07 know there's different compliance for
03:09 

03:09 different countries right so when it's
03:11 

03:11 GA it means like it'll work in general
03:14 

03:14 available across many different
03:15 

03:15 countries work in general it's available
03:17 

03:17 in general yeah so it's not like just
03:20 

03:20 exclusive to some because we do have
03:21 

03:21 some products that are still in beta and
03:24 

03:24 then it wouldn't be like GA right like
03:26 

03:26 we would be the one testing making sure
03:28 

03:28 it's ready for our clients to use and
03:31 

03:31 actually integrate properly with all
03:33 

03:33 their any kind of Tex that yeah right
03:36 

03:36 right so do you like come up with demos
03:38 

03:38 for them to show that it does work in a
03:41 

03:41 much smaller scale of your pro produ
03:44 

03:44 product so it will work for yours yeah
03:46 

03:46 something like that so usually different
03:48 

03:48 Merchants we call them Merchants our
03:50 

03:50 clients so different Merchants would
03:51 

03:51 request demos sometimes and we would
03:53 

03:53 actually present a technical
03:55 

03:55 demonstration for them so technical demo
03:57 

03:57 we would also provide technical Workshop
03:59 

03:59 so for like C Executives sometimes the
04:01 

04:01 CFO will be there CTO will be there and
04:03 

04:03 they want to know exactly the end to
04:05 

04:05 endend process of the integration and
04:07 

04:07 how the product will look like on their
04:08 

04:08 website so then we can provide mockups
04:11 

04:11 or if they want like something really
04:13 

04:13 like real we would even code them demos
04:16 

04:16 so uh but we are not software Engineers
04:19 

04:19 so that's something that I need to
04:20 

04:20 always mention to them we don't code for
04:22 

04:22 them so some of them will like ask us
04:24 

04:24 you know come and code for me like you
04:26 

04:26 know since you know the product so well
04:27 

04:27 right I will say no we canot do that
04:30 

04:30 that's against our policy we can only
04:31 

04:31 show you a very simplified demo like
04:34 

04:34 this is what it might look like but it
04:37 

04:37 won't be it it won't be like actually
04:40 

04:40 they can copy and paste our code right
04:42 

04:42 right wait I also remember you saying
04:45 

04:45 that you built internal tools for your
04:48 

04:48 organization other than like your um you
04:50 

04:50 know your more client facing like
04:52 

04:52 products yeah so the internal tools
04:54 

04:54 things usually um as an engineer
04:56 

04:56 ourselves we like to kind of um automate
04:59 

04:59 things right we kind of like to make
05:01 

05:01 things work more efficiently so if
05:03 

05:03 there's like a gap that we see that can
05:05 

05:05 automate those processes or things that
05:07 

05:07 we think would be convenient for our
05:08 

05:08 team or our sales colleagues then we
05:10 

05:10 would actually build internal tools so I
05:13 

05:13 have built an internal tool with my
05:15 

05:15 co-workers and we actually together
05:17 

05:17 built this playground so people can test
05:20 

05:20 all across like different platforms all
05:22 

05:22 our different products at once so we
05:25 

05:25 just have like a playground that can
05:26 

05:26 configure all those kind of um uh
05:29 

05:29 different set things like the buyer
05:30 

05:30 country or the amount and all that very
05:33 

05:33 easily through our all-in-one demo that
05:36 

05:36 we make like a playground yeah do you
05:38 

05:38 want to explain what an internal tool is
05:40 

05:40 in case like there are some people who
05:41 

05:41 you know don't really know the reference
05:43 

05:43 to it so an internal tool basically as
05:46 

05:46 uh it sounds like it's a tool that's
05:48 

05:48 used internally by our team so basically
05:52 

05:52 our team actually use all our playground
05:55 

05:55 that we built internally so we are not
05:58 

05:58 going to share that with the merchant
05:60 

05:60 we're not going to share them the code
06:01 

06:01 to that to our Merchant it's only to be
06:04 

06:04 used within our company and we're not
06:06 

06:06 supposed to even share it for the public
06:08 

06:08 so it's something that we ourselves are
06:10 

06:10 making it to make our lives better
06:13 

06:13 basically internally so it actually
06:15 

06:15 helped to simplify the processes and
06:17 

06:17 automate certain task M right right yeah
06:21 

06:21 do you have a a different definition of
06:23 

06:23 no no basically the same yeah but I I do
06:27 

06:27 understand that there might be like some
06:29 

06:29 nontechnical friends who might be asking
06:31 

06:31 what an internal tool is because like um
06:34 

06:34 I think a lot of people don't really
06:35 

06:35 have an understanding that developers
06:37 

06:37 themselves like Engineers themselves
06:39 

06:39 need to use like uh other applications
06:41 

06:41 and tools to help their process flow um
06:44 

06:44 even like uh the idea of developer
06:46 

06:46 experience like I know a lot of um
06:48 

06:48 developers themselves don't know that
06:50 

06:50 term so yeah I just wanted to like you
06:53 

06:53 know understand from your perspective um
06:55 

06:55 does the term internal tool like kind of
06:58 

06:58 like uh is it the same and I I guess
06:60 

06:60 it's basically the same yeah yeah yeah
07:02 

07:02 okay nice cool nice I was interested in
07:05 

07:05 like as a Solutions engineer what would
07:08 

07:08 be some kinds of uh kpi that you'll have
07:12 

07:12 to meet so actually our kpi is to enable
07:15 

07:15 sales growth so like again we work
07:18 

07:18 really closely with our sales team so uh
07:21 

07:21 whenever our sales you know have a lead
07:23 

07:23 right like we would have to follow up
07:25 

07:25 with them and we have to make sure that
07:26 

07:26 the integration process is all smooth
07:28 

07:28 and good so that can reach their target
07:31 

07:31 so all sales have the sales Target right
07:33 

07:33 and we want to help them do it so we
07:35 

07:35 have that as our kpi basically yeah it's
07:38 

07:38 I would say it kind of vary across
07:40 

07:40 companies probably uh but at least for
07:42 

07:42 my company it's it's more about that
07:44 

07:44 yeah enabling the sales do you get
07:47 

07:47 commission based on you no I'm an
07:49 

07:49 engineer unfortunately I'm not sales so
07:53 

07:53 no commission important question like
07:55 

07:55 it's always about yeah but but well yeah
07:59 

07:59 in a way I I still like how the job is
08:01 

08:01 like it's not super techy it's like
08:04 

08:04 quite like you know you can communicate
08:06 

08:06 across different teams so you get like a
08:07 

08:07 lot of like exposure how things work
08:10 

08:10 around the company how the company
08:11 

08:11 actually generates revenue and you know
08:14 

08:14 all that sorts of things because I think
08:16 

08:16 if you know we're just software engineer
08:18 

08:18 like then sometimes you don't know who
08:21 

08:21 is the End customer whereas as a
08:24 

08:24 Solutions engineer what I like about it
08:25 

08:25 is client facing so you get to hear
08:27 

08:27 directly what the client has to say
08:29 

08:29 about
08:30 

08:30 and that's why part of our scope is toer
08:32 

08:32 prodct feedb to the prodct team did you
08:35 

08:35 ever consider like um like a fully
08:38 

08:38 technical role instead of like a
08:39 

08:39 Solutions engineer maybe a full-on like
08:41 

08:41 software engineer like was that
08:43 

08:43 something you were considering yeah
08:45 

08:45 actually when I was you know not having
08:48 

08:48 this job I was like just doing blogging
08:49 

08:49 on the side um I was applying to
08:52 

08:52 different companies to be a software
08:54 

08:54 engineer because that was my initial
08:56 

08:56 goal since I didn't really know like
08:58 

08:58 what kind of career path can I do as I
09:01 

09:01 pivot into Tech so I thought software
09:04 

09:04 Engineers the only role that I can do if
09:06 

09:06 I pivot into Tech so I applied to be
09:08 

09:08 software engineer uh but actually I got
09:10 

09:10 the offer to be Solutions engineer cuz
09:13 

09:13 uh my company saw my blog and they say
09:16 

09:16 like wow you're really good at you know
09:17 

09:17 communication as well as the technical
09:19 

09:19 part so you're the best of both worlds
09:21 

09:21 so you know might as well say like you
09:24 

09:24 do Solutions engine right that and every
09:27 

09:27 time you tell us that I find it so
09:28 

09:28 amazing that it's something you were
09:30 

09:30 doing in your free time on the side and
09:32 

09:32 that was recognized as a skill by a
09:36 

09:36 company and then you were hired for that
09:38 

09:38 skill plus you know Tech skills
09:40 

09:40 communication like that's so amazing
09:43 

09:43 yeah that project kind of that's why I
09:47 

09:47 actually find that quite surreal right
09:49 

09:49 like I think everything has a chain
09:50 

09:50 effect you know it's like sometimes you
09:53 

09:53 just do it for the passion and naturally
09:56 

09:56 people will look for you like once you
09:58 

09:58 do it consistent enough
09:60 

09:60 yeah so and it means that you did it
10:01 

10:01 that well as well so I hope I hope so
10:05 

10:05 girl you're a GitHub star okay so like I
10:07 

10:07 think I just improve over time right
10:10 

10:10 like it's something that you know when I
10:12 

10:12 first started doing and I remember
10:13 

10:13 publishing my first article right it
10:15 

10:15 took me a month to publish it cuz I
10:17 

10:17 wrote it in 3 days but then I was
10:19 

10:19 thinking like oh this is not good enough
10:20 

10:20 so I just keep revising and revising it
10:23 

10:23 but then after I publish it after you
10:26 

10:26 know a month I realized that you know
10:28 

10:28 it's just for myself right like I didn't
10:30 

10:30 think anyone would read it but me like I
10:32 

10:32 was my own first audience so oh I like
10:35 

10:35 that yeah so I wrote it for myself but
10:38 

10:38 then slowly more people find it valuable
10:41 

10:41 and all that yeah and that's how I
10:43 

10:43 become consistent I actually remember
10:44 

10:44 you saying that your journey into
10:46 

10:46 technical blogging was actually you were
10:48 

10:48 trying to learn how to like code because
10:51 

10:51 you basically had sort of a midara
10:52 

10:52 switch do you want to kind of talk
10:54 

10:54 through that process about how you sure
10:56 

10:56 so I remember it was like during the co
10:58 

10:58 period right like all kind of stuck at
10:60 

10:60 home and I was thinking like okay what
11:02 

11:02 can I do like I always love to code like
11:05 

11:05 I think I mentioned it in the first
11:07 

11:07 episode like it was it first started
11:09 

11:09 with game development like in Visual
11:10 

11:10 Basic and I know and that was like back
11:14 

11:14 when I was like still in high school
11:16 

11:16 right but then um I took a degree in
11:19 

11:19 Commerce so during my whole undergrad
11:21 

11:21 dewe program I was like actually just
11:23 

11:23 coding on the side you know just making
11:24 

11:24 games as a hobby and then during covid
11:28 

11:28 hits that's when I have time for
11:30 

11:30 self-reflection that was when I realized
11:32 

11:32 that I don't really want to go into
11:34 

11:34 business finance yeah like I prefer
11:38 

11:38 going to to build things like I like to
11:40 

11:40 solve problems build things and so I
11:44 

11:44 decided to learn web development
11:45 

11:45 JavaScript and that's how I started like
11:48 

11:48 my journey to technical blogging because
11:50 

11:50 I thought that I need like some kind of
11:52 

11:52 log to like record my learnings yeah
11:55 

11:55 keep yourself accountable right right
11:57 

11:57 yeah so I did the 100 days of code
11:58 

11:58 challenge oh you did how was that wo so
12:02 

12:02 I wrote like an article every day for
12:04 

12:04 100 days right like summarizing what
12:06 

12:06 I've learned and all that what did you
12:08 

12:08 code every day so every day I'll build
12:11 

12:11 little projects so like first a to-do
12:14 

12:14 list of course and then second Chrome
12:16 

12:16 extensions and then slowly in one day or
12:19 

12:19 across a few across a few days yeah and
12:21 

12:21 I'll log what I learned I'll log the
12:23 

12:23 challenges I ran into and how I overcome
12:25 

12:25 them so that also helps me kind of like
12:27 

12:27 reflect on my debugging skills and then
12:29 

12:29 slowly I also attended heatons so that's
12:32 

12:32 how I also like collaborate with people
12:34 

12:34 right then I also log like you know day
12:37 

12:37 25 I actually went into this Heaton and
12:39 

12:39 we built together like a Geo
12:41 

12:41 navigational app you know and all that
12:43 

12:43 so slowly like the projects get more and
12:46 

12:46 more complex and I built like a chat
12:49 

12:49 like app and all that with like full
12:51 

12:51 stack database like that so as it gets
12:54 

12:54 more and more complicated I realized
12:56 

12:56 that hey I can actually start teaching
12:58 

12:58 people you know like how how to build
13:00 

13:00 these more complicated projects so then
13:03 

13:03 I started with like my very first like
13:05 

13:05 series that I wrote in my blog which is
13:07 

13:07 like my note JS series and until now
13:09 

13:09 people still like read it yeah so that
13:13 

13:13 one I actually published the article
13:15 

13:15 every day like for seven days I publish
13:18 

13:18 like it's a whole series yeah and then
13:20 

13:20 after that it just snowballed from there
13:23 

13:23 like my writing just took off like
13:25 

13:25 everyone was like saying like this is
13:26 

13:26 very helpful you know like they find a
13:28 

13:28 lot of value from it which also makes me
13:30 

13:30 proud because I actually learned through
13:32 

13:32 their comments their feedback as well so
13:33 

13:33 it makes me a better writer and a better
13:36 

13:36 writing Communicator overall yeah so I
13:39 

13:39 think the journey overall has been yeah
13:42 

13:42 has been quite good yeah no I mean like
13:44 

13:44 when we first met I was really like
13:47 

13:47 inspired by your technical blogging
13:49 

13:49 journey and I wanted to start my own so
13:51 

13:51 I was asking you for a lot of advice
13:53 

13:53 that was how I started the thing is like
13:55 

13:55 I would start on it and then it was like
13:58 

13:58 a whole year and I never completed even
13:60 

13:60 one article I had like a whole idea for
14:01 

14:01 a series you know to talk about uh mono
14:04 

14:04 repositories blah blah blah but I just
14:06 

14:06 couldn't even have like the discipline
14:08 

14:08 to like post it um like on a day onday
14:10 

14:10 basis and here you are you sh it out
14:13 

14:13 posted your first article and then you
14:14 

14:14 start it out with your no JS series and
14:16 

14:16 you're publishing like seven day on day
14:18 

14:18 like that really takes discipline and
14:21 

14:21 dedication yeah yeah remember when you
14:24 

14:24 first joined uh the wom code group uh
14:27 

14:27 even I was inspired by you I actually
14:28 

14:28 then did post an
14:31 

14:31 article right right yeah but I mean I
14:33 

14:33 did post for quite a a bit while you
14:36 

14:36 were still active and then I also
14:37 

14:37 stopped after a while it does take a lot
14:40 

14:40 of effort write but it's really useful
14:43 

14:43 like the reflection bit I would write
14:45 

14:45 about uh lead quote questions I would
14:47 

14:47 solve and I'll try to explain how I came
14:50 

14:50 to the solution and things around it
14:52 

14:52 have a lead quote series at one point as
14:54 

14:54 well but then I realized that I I prefer
14:57 

14:57 letting people kind of formulate their
14:59 

14:59 own Solutions cuz I I stopped after five
15:01 

15:01 articles of those Le code series just
15:04 

15:04 because I think a lot of people think
15:05 

15:05 this is the one way like this just one
15:08 

15:08 way of solving it but I want to
15:10 

15:10 encourage people to think like more
15:11 

15:11 differently right like there there's
15:13 

15:13 many solutions to one problem so that's
15:16 

15:16 why in a way it kind of stopped but
15:17 

15:17 that's actually a good start right cuz
15:19 

15:19 that's easy to pick up and easy to write
15:21 

15:21 about yeah I I'm very uh money oriented
15:25 

15:25 so I actually post on medium and that
15:28 

15:28 earns money as well medium earns you
15:31 

15:31 money yeah Medi partner program I mean I
15:35 

15:35 don't know I can't even publish my first
15:36 

15:36 article so cents per article per month
15:39 

15:39 uhhuh but it's still something it's
15:42 

15:42 that's really not you can get up to a
15:43 

15:43 dollar every mon a referral program so
15:46 

15:46 Sone you can refer me I can refer you
15:48 

15:48 and I get some money as well do I need
15:50 

15:50 to post to get money
15:52 

15:52 yes well um that's your motivation right
15:56 

15:56 there I will sit on it for another
15:60 

15:60 yeah yeah but no it's such a good idea I
16:02 

16:02 really like how you started posting
16:03 

16:03 about Le Co and here you are with the
16:05 

16:05 alternative Viewpoint that you started
16:08 

16:08 uh talking more about lead Cod but kind
16:09 

16:09 of stopped after a while when you
16:10 

16:10 realized like you want to give people
16:12 

16:12 the space to be creative yeah also just
16:14 

16:14 to Define what leak code is for like
16:16 

16:16 people who don't know what leak code is
16:18 

16:18 it's a series of um coding questions
16:21 

16:21 that you usually get during an interview
16:23 

16:23 these are not your typical like build-in
16:24 

16:24 app questions but uh kind of like things
16:27 

16:27 that test data structures algorithms um
16:30 

16:30 basically think of like calculus but
16:32 

16:32 like in one coding question yeah and
16:36 

16:36 usually like um yeah is that a good
16:38 

16:38 description yeah it's a new description
16:41 

16:41 but yeah yeah but it's like more more
16:43 

16:43 like specific to coding and data
16:45 

16:45 structures and algorithms and usually
16:48 

16:48 people practice for like 3 months to 8
16:50 

16:50 months just to prepare for these
16:52 

16:52 technical interviews um so yeah I think
16:55 

16:55 it's really interesting because a lot
16:57 

16:57 about like being tested on Le quote it's
16:59 

16:59 really hearing your thought process so I
17:01 

17:01 like that you know when you started uh
17:03 

17:03 blogging about it you're like hm maybe
17:05 

17:05 I'm kind of like you know introducing
17:07 

17:07 some kind of bias in that thought
17:08 

17:08 process probably that's why you didn't
17:10 

17:10 really cot about it with that right
17:12 

17:12 exactly yeah I I feel like that would
17:13 

17:13 kind of like indicate to people that
17:16 

17:16 there's only one way to explain things
17:17 

17:17 and there's only one way to solve the
17:19 

17:19 problems which I don't want people to
17:22 

17:22 think about right like or you know
17:24 

17:24 there's already cracking the coding
17:25 

17:25 interview book you know like which
17:27 

17:27 people kind of like just read like a
17:29 

17:29 Bible like read like a Bible exactly so
17:31 

17:31 I I don't want to be another source of
17:33 

17:33 that basically yeah yeah totally yeah so
17:37 

17:37 that's how I do I have a question do you
17:41 

17:41 earn money from your blogs
17:44 

17:44 yes yeah actually I do so um I have
17:47 

17:47 various channels of like how I earn
17:49 

17:49 blogging from blogging so the first one
17:51 

17:51 is medium so like you said I actually
17:53 

17:53 Syndicate My article so first I'll
17:55 

17:55 publish on my own personal Blog then
17:57 

17:57 after that I'll Syndicate to other
17:58 

17:58 different channels like medium def 2 um
18:02 

18:02 hacker noon like all those places and
18:05 

18:05 then after that I would get you know
18:07 

18:07 like from for median I get I'll get some
18:10 

18:10 kind of uh money from that and then I
18:12 

18:12 also get sponsored articles so a few
18:14 

18:14 companies reach out to me and then you
18:16 

18:16 know they would pay me to write them
18:18 

18:18 articles and usually at the end if it's
18:20 

18:20 a sponsored article I'll like indicate
18:21 

18:21 it's a sponsored article unless they
18:24 

18:24 explicitly State me not to mention it so
18:27 

18:27 yeah I also get a lot from sponsor
18:29 

18:29 articles and then next I also get a lot
18:31 

18:31 from sponsors so um hash note which is
18:34 

18:34 the blogging platform my blog ad they
18:36 

18:36 actually have like a sponsor program so
18:39 

18:39 you can actually donate to like your
18:40 

18:40 favorite authors and all that so oh yeah
18:43 

18:43 remember seeing you think it's like give
18:45 

18:45 me tea or something like that oh yes oh
18:47 

18:47 that one is my own it's like buy me cup
18:48 

18:48 of tea like buy me coffee but I I prefer
18:51 

18:51 tea so I'm like buy tea uh but hash note
18:55 

18:55 has their own now so it's like on hash
18:57 

18:57 note it's called hash note sponsors so I
18:60 

18:60 I'm not trying to be biased like my
19:02 

19:02 blogging platform I I remember I should
19:03 

19:03 put a disclaimer here like but it's just
19:05 

19:05 the first blogging platform I use so
19:07 

19:07 that's why I've been using it and they
19:09 

19:09 have this sponsorship program so that's
19:11 

19:11 how some people like kindly donate to me
19:14 

19:14 K sponsor yeah which is super nice so
19:17 

19:17 that's how I kind of earn for my blog
19:19 

19:19 yeah and I mean hash note is also the
19:21 

19:21 one the the platform that you use to
19:23 

19:23 publish our blogs for rag Tech so
19:26 

19:26 basically like you're writing the
19:27 

19:27 summary of like the episodes in case
19:30 

19:30 like people don't have time to watch it
19:31 

19:31 or want to watch like read the summary
19:33 

19:33 before watching it so you're using hash
19:35 

19:35 Noe as well for that right yeah cuz hash
19:37 

19:37 note they also support team blogs so
19:39 

19:39 like it's not just me who can write for
19:40 

19:40 our R Tech blog you guys also can write
19:43 

19:43 so so yeah yeah trying to make it a team
19:47 

19:47 blog right so it's not just me that's
19:48 

19:48 writing yeah so that's I think that's
19:51 

19:51 one of the beauty of um hash note
19:53 

19:53 because for medium um there's not really
19:56 

19:56 a team blog there's only like a
19:58 

19:58 publication they call it and uh it's
20:00 

20:00 kind of hard
20:02 

20:02 to um I would say it's okay but it's
20:05 

20:05 kind of hard to like really get credit
20:07 

20:07 for like your work like if you publish
20:10 

20:10 under medium so I'll say hash no is way
20:13 

20:13 much easier and also the audience for
20:15 

20:15 hash node are all like really into Tech
20:17 

20:17 so I think that's a more Niche blogging
20:19 

20:19 platform that would Target the right
20:21 

20:21 people more specialized blogging to te
20:23 

20:23 about it yeah so I had a question which
20:26 

20:26 was like so you have a 9 to5 yeah 5 to9
20:29 

20:29 9 to5 basically your job as a Solutions
20:31 

20:31 engineer 5 to 9 your job as a technical
20:34 

20:34 blogger how does your day usually look
20:36 

20:36 how do you like juggle uh like yeah I
20:39 

20:39 think a lot of people ask me this as
20:41 

20:41 well um I think the 925 is simple right
20:45 

20:45 you just focus on that one thing from 9
20:47 

20:47 to 5 so there's not much juggling there
20:50 

20:50 like it's already pretty like a set kind
20:52 

20:52 of um time blocking time blocking yeah
20:54 

20:54 so 925 I'll just focus on work 5 to9
20:57 

20:57 that that part would would take some
20:59 

20:59 discipline I would say so back when I
21:01 

21:01 was publishing once a week so very
21:03 

21:03 frequently um I would literally write
21:07 

21:07 every time after work so I would like
21:09 

21:09 you know after dinner after social
21:11 

21:11 events or something I'll go back home
21:13 

21:13 I'll block a time to write for two hours
21:15 

21:15 and then I'll continuously write and I
21:17 

21:17 would have so many um backlog of
21:21 

21:21 published articles to be published by
21:23 

21:23 that time like I will keep 8 to 10
21:25 

21:25 articles to be published oh nice back
21:29 

21:29 good backlog yeah yeah we're trying to
21:30 

21:30 figure out a backlog for this so exactly
21:34 

21:34 yeah so I think backlogs are important
21:35 

21:35 right so in the event like you get sick
21:37 

21:37 or something you can still have
21:38 

21:38 something to publish so I usually keep 8
21:41 

21:41 to 10 articles as a backlog and I would
21:44 

21:44 make sure I write at least one sentence
21:46 

21:46 every single day like that's like a
21:48 

21:48 promise I make to myself um of course as
21:50 

21:50 things get busier and now I'm juggling
21:52 

21:52 between Womanhood code this as well as
21:55 

21:55 blogging like it's not as
21:57 

21:57 straightforward as like like you know I
21:59 

21:59 just sit down and type especially now I
22:02 

22:02 only have nine fingers like wait what
22:03 

22:03 happened oh I cut my I cut this morning
22:07 

22:07 I don't know why I just why did so many
22:09 

22:09 things happen to you this morning you
22:10 

22:10 got allergies and you got your finger I
22:12 

22:12 know I know so like I woke up this
22:13 

22:13 morning and then it was bleeding and I
22:15 

22:15 was like oh oh what just randomly yeah I
22:18 

22:18 think it was too dry or something so it
22:20 

22:20 was bleeding and I'm like oh dang I
22:22 

22:22 can't write so you got a call in s at
22:24 

22:24 work my finger got cut I just woke up
22:26 

22:26 and it was like this yeah yeah so so so
22:29 

22:29 yeah with nine fingers not as fast uh
22:32 

22:32 but yeah I I Tred to at least keep my
22:35 

22:35 blog alive a little bit like right now
22:38 

22:38 I'm not blogging as frequently as before
22:40 

22:40 but it's okay because I know I'm
22:42 

22:42 focusing on like other different mediums
22:44 

22:44 and it's fine to actually like expand
22:47 

22:47 and you know do this with you guys yeah
22:50 

22:50 but yeah yeah I think it's fine yeah
22:53 

22:53 yeah I also want to like understand your
22:56 

22:56 journey from you mentioned your you
22:59 

22:59 studied Commerce in University and uh
23:03 

23:03 you you always wanted to be in Tech or
23:06 

23:06 not like you mentioned High School you
23:07 

23:07 were coding game development but you
23:10 

23:10 still took on Commerce why not computer
23:12 

23:12 science or like a it degree I I think I
23:15 

23:15 mentioned this in other podcast that
23:16 

23:16 I've been to before but my parents are
23:19 

23:19 quite traditional so they think you know
23:21 

23:21 coding computer science is many guiding
23:25 

23:25 right they they don't think it's really
23:26 

23:26 for girls and so they just encourag me
23:28 

23:28 to go into finance and commerce and at
23:31 

23:31 the time I don't really see myself to be
23:34 

23:34 a game developer just because it's like
23:36 

23:36 really stressful industry and like
23:38 

23:38 there's so many men like it's male
23:40 

23:40 dominated so I'm a bit intimidated by
23:43 

23:43 that and I thought you know this can
23:44 

23:44 just stay as a hobby like I never known
23:46 

23:46 like I would be intact as like a career
23:50 

23:50 because I thought I'll just be in
23:52 

23:52 Commerce you know I I'll just hang out
23:53 

23:53 there you know see what my options are
23:56 

23:56 as my parents suggested cuz you know I
23:57 

23:57 value their op opinion so that's how I
23:59 

23:59 got into Finance Commerce um and I did
24:02 

24:02 enjoy it for 4 years but at some point I
24:06 

24:06 do realize that my passion is in
24:07 

24:07 building and learning a lot of things
24:10 

24:10 and I feel like in the business World
24:13 

24:13 The Learning is not like how in Tech you
24:16 

24:16 know Tech is always growing it's always
24:17 

24:17 shifting it's always changing and I just
24:19 

24:19 find that exciting just because you know
24:21 

24:21 as a Ravenclaw and it's a type
24:24 

24:24 five I just I just want to continuously
24:26 

24:26 learn podcast on that but yeah sorry
24:29 

24:29 stoc like being a Ravenclaw yeah I just
24:33 

24:33 like the feeling of like continuous
24:35 

24:35 learning so that's why I like the
24:37 

24:37 feeling also of problem solving and
24:40 

24:40 actually using code to solve problem I I
24:42 

24:42 think that's also really cool right and
24:45 

24:45 at this point I want to make a statement
24:47 

24:47 is that anyone in this era right now
24:51 

24:51 should at least know a little bit how to
24:53 

24:53 code like should know at least a little
24:54 

24:54 bit how to read code because I do find
24:57 

24:57 like at least working with my sales
24:58 

24:58 colleagues those who can read code are
25:01 

25:01 like so much like more valuable because
25:04 

25:04 they can actually understand what's
25:06 

25:06 going on like even during technical
25:09 

25:09 presentations and all that those who can
25:11 

25:11 understand and at least listen what what
25:13 

25:13 is an API you know like what is like
25:16 

25:16 HTML like those who know can actually
25:19 

25:19 get in there and it's an advantage
25:22 

25:22 basically for sure so I would argue that
25:25 

25:25 it's a good thing that I study how to
25:27 

25:27 code like in a way at the time I just
25:29 

25:29 study how to code because I think it's
25:31 

25:31 really fun to build things like build
25:33 

25:33 games and then build websites after that
25:35 

25:35 so I think at this point everyone should
25:39 

25:39 also yeah it's just my opinion but yeah
25:42 

25:42 everyone should also at least know how
25:43 

25:43 to read M no yeah I I definitely agree
25:46 

25:46 with that as well that uh having like
25:49 

25:49 the tech Edge does does give you an
25:51 

25:51 advantage especially in the tech
25:53 

25:53 industry and almost all Fields right now
25:55 

25:55 are involved in Tech in some way or the
25:57 

25:57 other so yeah understand understanding
26:00 

26:00 basic things like API servers databases
26:04 

26:04 not necessarily reading code but
26:06 

26:06 understanding the systems around it does
26:08 

26:08 help a lot yeah yeah for sure I think
26:12 

26:12 even in any industry you're in like it
26:14 

26:14 is a business function now you know it's
26:17 

26:17 no longer like an industry on its own
26:19 

26:19 every single business needs um some will
26:23 

26:23 have to thrive in some sort of it
26:24 

26:24 infrastructure we'll have to have some
26:26 

26:26 sort of databases store that data
26:28 

26:28 um we'll have some sort of like frontend
26:30 

26:30 application that you know people would
26:33 

26:33 have to use so it's kind of like
26:34 

26:34 inevitable to kind of avoid Tech in
26:37 

26:37 general uh we're not saying that
26:39 

26:39 everybody has to be a master coder but
26:42 

26:42 really seeing like programming and
26:43 

26:43 coding as a universal skill and I think
26:46 

26:46 that's what the um universities DC are
26:49 

26:49 kind of like doing right now it's
26:51 

26:51 basically a module um that everybody has
26:53 

26:53 to go through yeah I don't know if like
26:55 

26:55 computer science as a class itself is
26:57 

26:57 like a a what do you call that General
26:60 

26:60 elective or like necessary elective
27:02 

27:02 class I don't think so nor okay yeah I
27:06 

27:06 don't know if it is now but I think like
27:08 

27:08 some way or another you know some kind
27:10 

27:10 of analytics class or like like
27:12 

27:12 everybody that I know now definitely
27:14 

27:14 knows a bit of python definitely knows
27:16 

27:16 okay maybe not so much JavaScript but
27:18 

27:18 some kind of has done C C++ in one kind
27:21 

27:21 of like modu so I do think it's becoming
27:23 

27:23 quite like even in my Commerce classes
27:26 

27:26 back then my Commerce class I was taking
27:28 

27:28 database management and you have to
27:30 

27:30 learn SQL
27:32 

27:32 what what kind of Commerce class is that
27:34 

27:34 like it's like it's like for
27:36 

27:36 infrastructure you know understanding
27:37 

27:37 see that's why I say even in Commerce is
27:39 

27:39 very important right cuz you need to
27:40 

27:40 know like how to organize your database
27:43 

27:43 I took like a database management class
27:45 

27:45 in my Master's course and you're doing
27:46 

27:46 it in like a Commerce undergrad yeah Dam
27:50 

27:50 yeah so we had to learn SQL for that we
27:52 

27:52 even have like an SQL competition you
27:54 

27:54 know she would give like a scenario and
27:56 

27:56 say okay now type the SQL in it and then
27:58 

27:58 we Tech we
27:59 

27:59 F what yeah oh that's that's pretty
28:02 

28:02 intense yeah my team won by the way theq
28:05 

28:05 oh okay okay weird flex but okay cuz I
28:09 

28:09 was proud cuz at the time all I know was
28:11 

28:11 C because of my unity game development
28:14 

28:14 but then I knew SQL now so I feel proud
28:17 

28:17 give you even more you have or but
28:19 

28:19 anyways yeah yeah so yeah that's pretty
28:23 

28:23 nice okay sweet yeah that's really like
28:26 

28:26 an interesting take on like looking at
28:29 

28:29 coding as a universal skill and also
28:31 

28:31 thank you so much for like talking us
28:33 

28:33 through what a Solutions engineer is you
28:35 

28:35 know your journey in technical blogging
28:36 

28:36 which is closely related to how you got
28:38 

28:38 into programming in the first place and
28:40 

28:40 yeah in general thanks for entertaining
28:42 

28:42 like salony and my questions that we
28:45 

28:45 don't really ask on an every day but now

28:52 preparing like literally I thought it
28:54 

28:54 was funny that when we asked about
28:55 

28:55 solution to engineering and you're like
28:57 

28:57 I have L girls yeah I I always have I
28:60 

28:60 have a standard answer that I send every
29:01

29:12 blogger that's why she got everything
29:14 

29:14 prepared and both of us are just like
29:17 

29:17 what's stuff we're engineering and I'm
29:20
