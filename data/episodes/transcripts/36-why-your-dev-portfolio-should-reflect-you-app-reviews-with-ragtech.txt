00:00 Hi everyone, welcome to RagTech, the
00:02 

00:02 place for bison and bentor. My name is
00:04 

00:04 Victoria. I'm a solutions engineer. Hi,
00:06 

00:06 I'm Natasha. I'm a software engineer.
00:12 

00:12 Oh, and Salon is frozen. But Salon is a
00:15 

00:15 software developer. And together we are
00:18 

00:18 Rectag. And um don't worry about Salone.
00:21 

00:21 She's coming back soon. Uh her Wi-Fi has
00:23 

00:23 just been quite intermittent.
00:24 

00:24 [Music]
00:28 

00:28 Previously, we did an app review episode
00:30 

00:30 where Sloan introduces her app and we
00:32 

00:32 kind of comment on it and I thought it's
00:34 

00:34 really good that we tried that and we
00:36 

00:36 wanted to do it again. So, this time
00:38 

00:38 we'll have Natasha to introduce us your
00:40 

00:40 project. Very excited for today's
00:42 

00:42 episode. In the last app review episode,
00:45 

00:45 Salon presented on her app, which was a
00:48 

00:48 nutrition analysis app uh that was
00:50 

00:50 powered by OpenAI, which was really
00:52 

00:52 cool. Mine's not as cool as that. I
00:54 

00:54 didn't use OpenAI or any AI power
00:56 

00:56 technologies, but it's just a very
00:59 

00:59 simple but also like really fun little
01:01 

01:01 project that I did for myself. I think
01:03 

01:03 about a year ago or maybe two years ago.
01:06 

01:06 It's basically my own web folio or web
01:09 

01:09 portfolio. So, this is how it looks
01:11 

01:11 like. So, as you can see, I bought my
01:14 

01:14 own domain name uh for the handle that I
01:16 

01:16 use across my socials. I will be taking
01:19 

01:19 both of you guys through what my app
01:22 

01:22 looks like and uh the little features
01:25 

01:25 that I'm kind of proud of. I actually am
01:27 

01:27 intending to do kind of like a not
01:29 

01:29 really so much of a revamp but I I think
01:31 

01:31 it's timely that I look at um little
01:33 

01:33 portions that I intend to revise um
01:36 

01:36 since you know I have different things
01:38 

01:38 that I want to showcase in my career and
01:40 

01:40 about myself. I love both of your
01:42 

01:42 feedback on it because I think both of
01:44 

01:44 you haven't really seen it before. I
01:45 

01:45 haven't like purposely like kind of
01:47 

01:47 shown it to people. Here we are at on
01:50 

01:50 the landing page. Um, and as you can
01:53 

01:53 see, there's a little avatar of myself
01:56 

01:56 and my cat. Um, and a little dialogue
01:60 

01:60 box. And um, when you click on the
02:02 

02:02 dialogue box, okay, here it says, "Hey
02:04 

02:04 there, I'm Natasha N, a software
02:05 

02:05 engineer, tech podcaster, and tech
02:07 

02:07 community lead." Um, so yeah, when you
02:09 

02:09 click okay, then it's it's the next
02:13 

02:13 dialogue and it's just more intro. But
02:16 

02:16 basically, I think you can tell from
02:18 

02:18 this vibe where I was getting like
02:21 

02:21 inspiration from. Um, I really wanted it
02:24 

02:24 to be like slightly gified. Like I
02:27 

02:27 really enjoy Harvest Moon as a child,
02:29 

02:29 which is basically a uh an older version
02:33 

02:33 of Stardw Valley. I've never played
02:34 

02:34 Stardw Valley, but I really loved
02:36 

02:36 Harvest Moon and I just really wanted to
02:38 

02:38 showcase like a more fun side uh of
02:41 

02:41 myself through my uh wet folio because
02:44 

02:44 like I think my LinkedIn is already like
02:46 

02:46 professionalish looking, right? I think
02:49 

02:49 in my endeavor as a techie as well as
02:52 

02:52 you know somebody who uh talks a about
02:55 

02:55 like different social and community
02:57 

02:57 issues, I really wanted a more
02:58 

02:58 light-hearted and casual spin on it. I'm
03:01 

03:01 more approachable and people don't take
03:04 

03:04 me like incredibly seriously. Kind of
03:07 

03:07 like our podcast, I guess. Like we're
03:09 

03:09 trying to make um talking about tech and
03:11 

03:11 the realities of life in tech more
03:13 

03:13 accessible and more um authentic and uh
03:17 

03:17 relatable. So I guess that was what I
03:19 

03:19 was going for and that's why I decided,
03:21 

03:21 okay, let's make it like kind of cute
03:24 

03:24 and gy. Um so
03:27 

03:27 >> you love I knew you would love it
03:28 

03:28 because like Yeah. Yeah. because you're
03:30 

03:30 a Pokemon fan and you play so many
03:32 

03:32 games. Like if you guys don't know, Ora
03:34 

03:34 like started off like her app
03:36 

03:36 development journey with like more
03:38 

03:38 gamedev stuff, right? Like you you kind
03:40 

03:40 of dabble here and there. Like you can
03:42 

03:42 go to her blog and then you'll be able
03:43 

03:43 to read her journey and her earlier
03:45 

03:45 projects. One of them was like a Pokemon
03:47 

03:47 inspired project.
03:48 

03:48 >> My projects are always so Pokemon based.
03:50 

03:50 So I love it. It's really It reminds me
03:53 

03:53 of like those pixel art games. So I know
03:56 

03:56 Harvest Moon is a pixel art art style.
03:58 

03:58 So,
03:59 

03:59 >> I love how you can recreate that feel.
04:02 

04:02 And I know you haven't introduced your
04:04 

04:04 entire website, but I would like to ask
04:05 

04:05 how did you like learn how to draw pixel
04:08 

04:08 art and what what app do you use? What
04:10 

04:10 program to draw it?
04:11 

04:11 >> Yeah, so I drew the one on the left on
04:14 

04:14 Clip Studio Art. Um, I think I had like
04:17 

04:17 a phase where I was drawing a lot. I
04:19 

04:19 actually have like my own web tune
04:22 

04:22 comic. Oh my gosh. Let me see if I can
04:23 

04:23 >> You have assets. You You created your
04:25 

04:25 own assets.
04:27 

04:27 >> Yeah. Uh, I had like a whole like um
04:33 

04:33 drawing face. Oh my god.
04:36 

04:36 >> Oh my god. Amazing.
04:38 

04:38 >> Cuz like I had this um period of my life
04:41 

04:41 where I broke my ankle and I was
04:44 

04:44 extremely depressed and I didn't have I
04:46 

04:46 couldn't move. I didn't have anything to
04:48 

04:48 do. And I don't know why like coding
04:50 

04:50 just didn't bring me joy at that point
04:52 

04:52 of time. And then I went into digital
04:54 

04:54 art and I started drawing a lot. This
04:57 

04:57 one is about my fostering journey and I
05:00 

05:00 have like a slightly more
05:04 

05:04 >> seriousish sci-fiish one.
05:07 

05:07 >> Wow. Yeah.
05:10 

05:10 >> That is amazing.
05:14 

05:14 >> Yeah. I think like this was around the
05:16 

05:16 same time that I also created the web
05:18 

05:18 folio and I was just like okay so I have
05:21 

05:21 like two different uh drawing styles
05:23 

05:23 here and I just wanted to intro
05:25 

05:25 introduce like a third drawing style and
05:27 

05:27 I was like I really like pixel art. I
05:28 

05:28 want to see like how people do that. So
05:32 

05:32 um yeah I used like the same um platform
05:36 

05:36 Clip Studio Art to just kind of draw. Um
05:40 

05:40 and this time like I had to do it uh
05:42 

05:42 pixel by pixel. I did like get like the
05:45 

05:45 little harvest moon um avatar. Um uh I
05:49 

05:49 used it as like inspiration and I
05:51 

05:51 overlaid but then you know I put like
05:53 

05:53 what I thought were my own personal
05:55 

05:55 features on it. So that's the one on the
05:57 

05:57 left side and actually when you want to
05:59 

05:59 um create a sprite you have the entire
06:01 

06:01 texture consists of like left, right,
06:03 

06:03 center and stuff. So actually the
06:04 

06:04 landing page used to be like a whole
06:07 

06:07 thing where you could move my sprite
06:09 

06:09 >> like use arrow keys and then move up and
06:11 

06:11 down.
06:12 

06:12 >> Yeah. But then I realized it was
06:14 

06:14 actually pretty bad UX- wise to navigate
06:18 

06:18 around.
06:19 

06:19 >> It's kind of cool though. How about like
06:20 

06:20 using arrow keys on the keyboard itself
06:22 

06:22 to move?
06:23 

06:23 >> Yeah. Yeah. So I I could it was actually
06:26 

06:26 using arrow keys. Um
06:28 

06:28 >> Okay. Okay.
06:28 

06:28 >> And like if you used it on phone, you
06:31 

06:31 would be pressing arrow keys on the
06:33 

06:33 phone. But I it was just like at first I
06:36 

06:36 was like, "Oh, locations could be like
06:38 

06:38 uh basically the tabs of my uh uh web
06:41 

06:41 folio. But then I realized it was just
06:44 

06:44 kind of like clunky and the
06:45 

06:45 responsiveness I had to deal with a lot
06:47 

06:47 of web responsiveness issue device um
06:50 

06:50 width and all of that and after a while
06:52 

06:52 I was just like okay let's just make it
06:53 

06:53 clean and simple otherwise I would never
06:55 

06:55 ever like publish this. So yes that's
06:59 

06:59 where I was at. So the left side I
07:02 

07:02 actually had like um the entire sprite
07:05 

07:05 texture out uh left right center but
07:07 

07:07 this is the front one. So, you can see
07:08 

07:08 that this is static. And then the one on
07:10 

07:10 the right of my cat, Pip. I live on my
07:13 

07:13 own with my two cats, Pip and Po. This
07:15 

07:15 is my cat, Pip. Uh, Po isn't here
07:17 

07:17 virtually yet, but she soon will be
07:19 

07:19 because I never got to drawing her when
07:21 

07:21 she came along. Pip came first before
07:23 

07:23 Po. So,
07:26 

07:26 >> this is so cute.
07:28 

07:28 >> Thanks, Pip. Our virtual home is here.
07:31 

07:31 It is in the middle of a refresh, but
07:33 

07:33 feel free to explore. Um, so the
07:35 

07:35 interesting part about like this one is
07:38 

07:38 it's not drawn on like like uh with
07:41 

07:41 digital art, but I actually like mapped
07:44 

07:44 the pixels out. Um, I coded the SVG out
07:47 

07:47 one by one because I wanted to try uh to
07:50 

07:50 create a new style of animation. It's
07:53 

07:53 like an SVG on its own. Basically, I
07:56 

07:56 created a loop to loop through like the
07:58 

07:58 different like the closed eyes and
07:60 

07:60 everything. And I had like a whole thing
08:01 

08:01 where you could change the color of the
08:03 

08:03 cat and stuff like that. People could
08:05 

08:05 play with it. Yeah, I'll show you guys.
08:07 

08:07 >> I actually remember uh interacting with
08:10 

08:10 that.
08:10 

08:10 >> I think you posted it
08:12 

08:12 >> posted it like when you first came on uh
08:16 

08:16 and then you showed us your website and
08:18 

08:18 I remember it was customizable. You
08:20 

08:20 could we could design your
08:23 

08:23 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
08:25 

08:25 >> That was so amazing. remove it.
08:28 

08:28 >> I was cleaning up like just
08:31 

08:31 a while ago. Oh my gosh. Okay.
08:34 

08:34 >> Yes. Yes.
08:35 

08:35 >> Yeah. So, it there used to be another
08:37 

08:37 tab here called projects, but I removed
08:39 

08:39 it because like um otherwise, as you can
08:42 

08:42 see, if it's on the phone, it it went
08:45 

08:45 over and then I just didn't have time at
08:47 

08:47 that point of time to like think about
08:48 

08:48 like what's a good way to like um do
08:51 

08:51 that. So, but um obviously it's new
08:54 

08:54 here. So actually, yeah, you could
08:57 

08:57 actually you could change the eyes and
08:59 

08:59 you could change the fur. That is not
09:02 

09:02 brown. That's okay. You know what? Like
09:06 

09:06 I don't know. You could change the m
09:08 

09:08 like the head pattern. But this is very
09:10 

09:10 biased towards how pip looks. So I can't
09:12 

09:12 really create pole from this. But yeah,
09:17 

09:17 basically. Okay, I'll put this back on.
09:19 

09:19 Like I I need like a way to put it back
09:21 

09:21 on. I just haven't really thought about
09:23 

09:23 it. ends the need to do a revamp, right?
09:26 

09:26 And that's why we're doing a review
09:27 

09:27 today. But yes, that is how I kind of
09:30 

09:30 like created like the cat. So, even
09:32 

09:32 though both are sprites, um they're
09:34 

09:34 created very differently. One is like um
09:38 

09:38 drawn and then like set on a texture,
09:40 

09:40 like I really wanted it to also like uh
09:42 

09:42 move around at at some point. It was
09:44 

09:44 toggable with like arrow keys. Um but I
09:48 

09:48 was just like, okay, whatever. Um
09:50 

09:50 minimum viable product, right? Just put
09:51 

09:51 it out there. And but this one is um
09:55 

09:55 code generated basically.
09:57 

09:57 >> Yeah. So I guess somebody wanted to
09:60 

09:60 create NFTTS.
10:03 

10:03 >> Yeah. And then the dialogue box by
10:06 

10:06 itself was also pretty fun coding it
10:09 

10:09 because it surprisingly required um like
10:12 

10:12 the text by itself
10:15 

10:15 um because it's like typewriter. Okay.
10:17 

10:17 See like sometimes it glitches. I still
10:19 

10:19 haven't like found out why. But um to
10:23 

10:23 kind of like create that uh function for
10:25 

10:25 it to appear character by character was
10:29 

10:29 actually quite a challenge by itself.
10:32 

10:32 But
10:32 

10:32 >> is it is it just CSS or did you also use
10:35 

10:35 JavaScript to make the type by character
10:37 

10:37 by character?
10:38 

10:38 >> What did I use?
10:41 

10:41 >> Nowadays like there's so many libraries
10:43 

10:43 to create these kind of effects. I don't
10:46 

10:46 even remember when I did something so
10:49 

10:49 lower level.
10:50 

10:50 >> Yeah. So, another thing that I did,
10:53 

10:53 yeah, on the more coding, like techie
10:55 

10:55 technical side of the house, my
10:57 

10:57 challenge to myself was like I really
10:59 

10:59 wanted to go as lowle as possible, as
11:00 

11:00 raw as possible. I think there was some
11:03 

11:03 point it was like pure vanilla like JS.
11:05 

11:05 But then I was just like, okay,
11:08 

11:08 okay, done with that experiment. I I
11:10 

11:10 should probably um just code it in
11:12 

11:12 React. um this this whole thing there
11:15 

11:15 there's also another thing at that point
11:16 

11:16 I was very into mono repositories like
11:19 

11:19 the concept of like putting everything
11:21 

11:21 in one repository
11:23 

11:23 um despite uh having like different
11:25 

11:25 features that are um incredibly
11:27 

11:27 different um so for audience members who
11:31 

11:31 don't really understand the concept of
11:32 

11:32 motor repositories and like poly
11:34 

11:34 repositories basically um oh wait
11:37 

11:37 actually I have a at some point I did
11:40 

11:40 like a blog post on this yeah
11:43 

11:43 Wow, nice.
11:45 

11:45 >> Basically, um if it's like working in a
11:49 

11:49 team and um your entire team has uh one
11:53 

11:53 Google Drive versus um your entire team
11:57 

11:57 has like various Google Drive uh divided
11:60 

11:60 into different departments. So this is
12:03 

12:03 the one with like a singular Google
12:05 

12:05 Drive and then this is the one with like
12:08 

12:08 um different Google drives. And
12:10 

12:10 technically the one on the right is more
12:12 

12:12 commonplace and typical um so that it's
12:16 

12:16 um
12:17 

12:17 I don't want to say easier to
12:19 

12:19 collaborate. I would say it's just more
12:20 

12:20 conventional because it depends on the
12:22 

12:22 project itself. Um but um I at that
12:25 

12:25 point I think I found out that Google um
12:28 

12:28 the entire organization used only one
12:31 

12:31 like moto repository to co to put their
12:33 

12:33 code in. So there was only one like
12:35 

12:35 Google drive. So I was just like, hm,
12:37 

12:37 I'm going to explore this, too. So yeah,
12:41 

12:41 that's kind of like what I did here for
12:43 

12:43 the people who can recognize it. And um
12:47 

12:47 that was also another thing that I
12:48 

12:48 wanted to like revamp actually because
12:50 

12:50 now I have a lot of like fun little
12:53 

12:53 packages like the UI itself. I was just
12:55 

12:55 like, oh, it' be fun to kind of share it
12:57 

12:57 and see if like other people wanted to
12:59 

12:59 contribute or like I don't know, like
13:01 

13:01 use it. And then I also had like the
13:04 

13:04 mini I did it wasn't very creative to
13:07 

13:07 the name, but the mini me is basically
13:08 

13:08 the um the animation of the sprite.
13:13 

13:13 >> So yeah, I was thinking like, oh, I kind
13:15 

13:15 of want to like make these uh as
13:17 

13:17 individual repositories on GitHub so
13:20 

13:20 that other people could like use it too
13:21 

13:21 or like contribute to it.
13:23 

13:23 >> So now I guess I'm also realizing the
13:26 

13:26 pros and cons of a mono repository. it
13:28 

13:28 did make like working with it very
13:30 

13:30 quickly because I could just change like
13:32 

13:32 code within the same repository. I also
13:35 

13:35 used Turbo Repo um to manage the entire
13:38 

13:38 mono repository that made it really
13:40 

13:40 easy. Um but yes, that was like
13:44 

13:44 something that I wanted to change. But
13:46 

13:46 this is a good segue um into this part
13:51 

13:51 my um app.
13:54 

13:54 this I wanted it to be like a little
13:56 

13:56 diary like a scrapbook. Um so that's
14:01 

14:01 kind of like what I did and I stayed
14:03 

14:03 with the whole pixel art form. This was
14:04 

14:04 actually really hard to do because I had
14:08 

14:08 to take into account um device
14:10 

14:10 responsiveness. So you can see like on
14:13 

14:13 the phone I at first it was just like
14:15 

14:15 the landscape orientation of the diary
14:19 

14:19 that I was like oh then you can't really
14:20 

14:20 like click and see anything. But then
14:22 

14:22 after that I was like, "Oh, I can just
14:24 

14:24 kind of
14:26 

14:26 >> um kind of
14:27 

14:27 >> yeah portrait modeed."
14:29 

14:29 >> But okay, obviously you can see this is
14:31 

14:31 kind of glitchy because I didn't take
14:34 

14:34 into account how much I should truncate
14:36 

14:36 for different device widths.
14:38 

14:38 >> So probably something I have to work on.
14:40 

14:40 And as you can see, I was not I had the
14:43 

14:43 whole like phase where I was very
14:44 

14:44 inspired by Victoria and her tech
14:46 

14:46 blogging. So I was like, I'm gonna do
14:48 

14:48 it. And I wrote this and I was like, "Oh
14:53 

14:53 yeah, there'll be a second part.
14:54 

14:54 There'll be a third part to be
14:55 

14:55 continued." And I never continued. This
14:57 

14:57 was
15:00 

15:00 >> okay.
15:01 

15:01 >> September 2023.
15:04 

15:04 >> Yeah. I don't know how you have the
15:05 

15:05 diligence like Victoria to like
15:07 

15:07 >> It gets easier the more you write. So I
15:09 

15:09 I know after my first uh article, it
15:12 

15:12 took me a month to like start another
15:14 

15:14 one. So it always takes uh time. Yeah.
15:17 

15:17 You just have to tell yourself, I'm
15:19 

15:19 going to do it again. Give yourself a
15:21 

15:21 virtual deadline. Like, you must have it
15:23 

15:23 done by that date.
15:25 

15:25 >> Okay. Part two is going to be like
15:28 

15:28 >> it's all I have
15:29 

15:29 >> 2024.
15:31 

15:31 >> I I have like I have discipline but in a
15:34 

15:34 very weird way. So, I'm like reliable
15:36 

15:36 but not consistent if that makes sense.
15:38 

15:38 It's like I'm the type of person who's
15:40 

15:40 like you give me a deadline, I will meet
15:41 

15:41 it, but don't ex uh but if you're
15:43 

15:43 checking on me every single day to see
15:45 

15:45 if I'm I'm working on it, you will
15:47 

15:47 realize that I am not. So yeah, I I just
15:52 

15:52 realized that about myself and I was
15:53 

15:53 like, "Oh, this is so hard to explain to
15:55 

15:55 people and to like, you know, people
15:57 

15:57 want that assurance that you're working
15:58 

15:58 on something, but at the same time, my
16:00 

16:00 energy levels are always like so you can
16:03 

16:03 see this entire app was like one burst,
16:05 

16:05 one sprint, and then I never touched it
16:07 

16:07 like one year later, but now I want to
16:11 

16:11 touch it. I want to have the diligence
16:12 

16:12 that Victoria has."
16:14 

16:14 >> Yeah. Oh, also,
16:15 

16:15 >> do you want us to help you?
16:16 

16:16 >> Yes, we can give you a deadline. We can
16:18 

16:18 help you. Ah, I think I need
16:20 

16:20 accountability so bad. Like I think like
16:23 

16:23 we do really well in this podcast
16:25 

16:25 because like I have you guys to keep me
16:28 

16:28 like accountable. We have deadlines and
16:30 

16:30 I'm accountable to y'alls. But when it
16:32 

16:32 comes to my own personal stuff, it's
16:33 

16:33 just like I'm waiting for like that
16:35 

16:35 burst of energy and I'll just do it. And
16:38 

16:38 then after a while I get overwhelmed and
16:39 

16:39 I'll be like
16:41 

16:41 >> I think for side projects is often like
16:43 

16:43 that because we'll be like so
16:44 

16:44 preoccupied with our main occupation
16:46 

16:46 like our day job. That's true. that
16:48 

16:48 sometimes at night like you know we want
16:50 

16:50 to do the 9 to5 and then 5 to9 like what
16:53 

16:53 Sloan has said before but sometimes that
16:55 

16:55 5 to9 is hard like cuz after the 9 to5
16:58 

16:58 your your brain is just very exhausted.
17:01 

17:01 >> Yeah.
17:02 

17:02 >> Yeah. Yeah.
17:02 

17:02 >> You just need to be really like
17:05 

17:05 disciplined to like push yourself to do
17:07 

17:07 it. But I know it's very hard. Yeah.
17:09 

17:09 >> Exactly. I know we talk a lot in our
17:11 

17:11 podcast about how good it is to have
17:13 

17:13 side projects. uh even when you have
17:15 

17:15 like a full-time job, like it's always
17:17 

17:17 good to have side projects um in case
17:20 

17:20 you need to have your resume ready at
17:22 

17:22 any point of time. But the reality of it
17:25 

17:25 is it's kind of hard to stay consistent
17:27 

17:27 and committed to a side project. Um
17:30 

17:30 because you know, you're not getting
17:32 

17:32 paid for it. That's one. So you don't
17:34 

17:34 have the monetary incentive to keep you
17:36 

17:36 accountable. And then two, it's just
17:39 

17:39 like
17:40 

17:40 >> I don't know. It's just for your own
17:41 

17:41 learning purpose. So you get to pace
17:43 

17:43 yourself.
17:44 

17:44 >> And I think the the third one is that
17:46 

17:46 especially when you have a job or even
17:48 

17:48 if you don't have a job, you're also
17:49 

17:49 probably actively recruiting. It's very
17:51 

17:51 hard to like find time for that. So I
17:54 

17:54 think time
17:55 

17:55 >> that you know Salony mentioned is really
17:58 

17:58 the discipline. Like that's one.
17:60 

17:60 >> Um two like uh I I think for me it's
18:03 

18:03 realizing the kind of cadence that I
18:05 

18:05 work at and not everybody has the same
18:07 

18:07 type of cadence. I think I was like
18:09 

18:09 really hard up by myself. um thinking
18:12 

18:12 that okay I need discipline for if if
18:16 

18:16 discipline for other people means
18:17 

18:17 keeping to a routine like posting and
18:20 

18:20 writing every week um let's try to do
18:22 

18:22 that and I realized like but I have um
18:25 

18:25 incredibly fluctuating like energy
18:27 

18:27 levels and capacities
18:30 

18:30 um keeping to like that kind of timeline
18:33 

18:33 like made me really stressed out and
18:35 

18:35 overwhelmed me even more and enhance the
18:37 

18:37 procrastination actually um so I had to
18:40 

18:40 like understand how I work and kind of
18:43 

18:43 adapt that to myself, see what motivates
18:45 

18:45 me. So yeah, that's on that journey.
18:50 

18:50 >> Yeah.
18:51 

18:51 >> But I like how like your side project,
18:53 

18:53 especially for this one, it it really
18:55 

18:55 showcase your individuality and like it
18:58 

18:58 showcase your creativity as well cuz I
19:00 

19:00 think most people when they make side
19:02 

19:02 projects, they just follow tutorials,
19:03 

19:03 right? like, oh, especially for
19:05 

19:05 beginners, it'll be like the classic
19:07 

19:07 to-do app or the classic weather app,
19:09 

19:09 >> but then they they don't make something
19:10 

19:10 that really showcases their identity or
19:13 

19:13 like something that they truly want to
19:14 

19:14 learn. I love how like you said you want
19:16 

19:16 to learn everything, so you did it
19:18 

19:18 lowlevel. You did everything by
19:20 

19:20 JavaScript at first just so that you can
19:22 

19:22 learn something. And I think sometimes
19:24 

19:24 doing that instead of relying on
19:26 

19:26 libraries, that also kind of trains you
19:28 

19:28 in a way cuz then you realize how are
19:31 

19:31 these libraries being written also.
19:33 

19:33 Yeah,
19:33 

19:33 >> cuz technically you're writing yourself
19:35 

19:35 kind of like a library, you know, by
19:36 

19:36 writing the low-level code. So yeah.
19:39 

19:39 >> So yeah, I love how like all this even
19:41 

19:41 though it took you a year, but it's like
19:44 

19:44 slow pace learning like at your own pace
19:46 

19:46 basically
19:47 

19:47 >> and then it's your personality and your
19:50 

19:50 identity
19:51 

19:51 >> like all the pixel art and and see like
19:53 

19:53 even some skills that developers think
19:56 

19:56 is like they think all you need to learn
19:57 

19:57 is like coding like JavaScript skills
19:60 

19:60 but see I love how you incorporate your
20:01 

20:01 pixel art skills too like your artistic
20:03 

20:03 abilities. it can also be part of like
20:06 

20:06 projects just like as technical as this.
20:08 

20:08 So
20:09 

20:09 >> yeah, honestly it's great to understand
20:11 

20:11 that part like because with pixel art um
20:15 

20:15 it it requires an understanding of uh uh
20:17 

20:17 like with like the literal pixels that
20:20 

20:20 you work with the the bits that you work
20:22 

20:22 with and then having to like literally
20:25 

20:25 um draw with code was quite an exercise
20:28 

20:28 uh in appreciating that kind of having
20:31 

20:31 the spatial awareness of the space that
20:32 

20:32 you're coding in. you know, like uh
20:34 

20:34 things have to be relative to each other
20:36 

20:36 and especially in the SVG code format. I
20:39 

20:39 thought it was just like really fun to
20:41 

20:41 like explore that and I'm so glad you
20:43 

20:43 brought up the um the the the point that
20:46 

20:46 you know a personal side project, a wet
20:49 

20:49 folio or like even like a food nutrition
20:51 

20:51 analysis app like Salon, it should
20:54 

20:54 showcase like your individuality.
20:57 

20:57 Um because if we we go back to using
20:60 

20:60 this as like tech recruitment material
21:03 

21:03 like it should really speak to your tone
21:04 

21:04 of voice. It should really speak to like
21:07 

21:07 what you bring to the table, what kind
21:08 

21:08 of values you stand for. Um you're not
21:12 

21:12 just a software engineer like
21:14 

21:14 run-of-the-mill, but what other things
21:16 

21:16 um do you do? And I think for me, you're
21:18 

21:18 spot on in that I really wanted to like
21:21 

21:21 showcase that um I was more than just
21:25 

21:25 like a a a software engineer in the
21:28 

21:28 sense that I was also an artist. I guess
21:30 

21:30 I was also fun and quirky and more
21:32 

21:32 importantly I like to learn uh different
21:35 

21:35 things and I'm not scared to, you know,
21:37 

21:37 um take the long way around and actually
21:39 

21:39 a lot of these things were the long way
21:41 

21:41 around for the purpose of learning.
21:43 

21:43 Thank you for tuning in to part one of
21:45 

21:45 Natasha's app review on Rectag. In the
21:47 

21:47 next part, we'll be looking at how she
21:49 

21:49 used the free method of hosting content
21:51 

21:51 for the blog feature of her webfolio,
21:53 

21:53 while Victoria will also chime in on her
21:56 

21:56 tech blogging expertise. We'll also be
21:58 

21:58 walking through the link tree feature on
22:00 

22:00 her web folio where she puts links to
22:02 

22:02 her socials and communities for easy
22:04 

22:04 access while the team talks about the
22:06 

22:06 importance of personal branding in
22:08 

22:08 today's era of tech recruitment. As
22:11 

22:11 always, this was Recte, the place for
22:13 

22:13 bites and banter. Remember to like,
22:16 

22:16 subscribe, follow, and comment, and
22:18
