00:01 They constantly rant about the birth
00:03 

00:03 rate being so low, right? It's no
00:05 

00:05 wonder, man, it is so tough. Four months
00:08 

00:08 for the woman and one month for the man.
00:09 

00:09 And that's only if the company allows
00:11 

00:11 that. My my wife enjoys her career and
00:15 

00:15 um makes good money. So, we decided
00:18 

00:18 that I'm done with my career anyways, so
00:21 

00:21 why don't I just stay at home? Everybody
00:24 

00:24 needs to be very good at school so that
00:26 

00:26 they get into the best university so
00:27 

00:27 that they can get for UPS.
00:30 

00:30 I don't know. I don't see that future
00:32 

00:32 for my daughter.
00:34 

00:34 [Music]
00:38 

00:38 That's why you're able to retire today.
00:39 

00:39 And we also hear that, you know, you
00:41 

00:41 mentioned about you being a dad. So, we
00:44 

00:44 wanted to talk about that. How has that
00:45 

00:45 been for you? Uh, incredible. Truly
00:48 

00:48 incredible.
00:50 

00:50 Um, it's
00:51 

00:51 like the first week after the baby is
00:54 

00:54 out, like my my world view completely
00:57 

00:57 changed. like uh we wanted to have a
00:60 

01:00 baby always for a long time. It just
01:02 

01:02 didn't happen. So we were actually
01:03 

01:03 getting quite desperate and we were
01:04 

01:04 thinking about doing IVF in the end and
01:07 

01:07 then when we were like okay next month
01:08 

01:08 we start IVF then we realize oh we're
01:10 

01:10 thank
01:11 

01:11 god. So um totally got lucky. Um but
01:16 

01:16 yeah uh I can I can I have a lot of
01:20 

01:20 respect now for for any person in the
01:23 

01:23 mall that I see with with a little one.
01:25 

01:25 anyone who goes to work and and has a
01:27 

01:27 little one at home. I have a huge amount
01:29 

01:29 of respect now. I so it's so exhausting
01:33 

01:33 to have a child. Oh my god, I had no
01:35 

01:35 idea. And the craziest thing is I
01:39 

01:39 constantly ask myself, how did my
01:40 

01:40 parents get them done? We have it so
01:43 

01:43 easy. When we want anything, we can
01:45 

01:45 order from Amazon. When we when we don't
01:48 

01:48 want to cook, we just order it from
01:50 

01:50 Grab, right? Uh we have perfect system
01:52 

01:52 here with Grab. We don't even need to
01:54 

01:54 have a car. we could just, you know, sit
01:55 

01:55 with the baby on the back seat and take
01:56 

01:56 a taxi, go somewhere. All this stuff
01:58 

01:58 didn't exist. My mom had to drive around
02:01 

02:01 with us screaming on the back probably
02:03 

02:03 to the mall to get stuff done and buy. I
02:05 

02:05 I have no idea how she did that truly.
02:07 

02:07 Um, so yeah, and then and I guess
02:11 

02:11 Singapore being a very expensive place,
02:13 

02:13 meaning that usually both parents are
02:16 

02:16 working and that's so tough. I really
02:19 

02:19 don't know how people do this. So I I
02:21 

02:21 feel like we are very very blessed that
02:23 

02:23 I can choose to stay at home and and
02:25 

02:25 focus on the child. Yeah. And it's
02:28 

02:28 interesting that uh it's it's the father
02:30 

02:30 this time. We usually hear the the mom
02:33 

02:33 staying at home. Yeah. Um well my wife
02:38 

02:38 enjoys her career and um makes good
02:40 

02:40 money. So we decided
02:43 

02:43 that I'm done with my career anyways. So
02:46 

02:46 why don't I just stay at home? And I
02:48 

02:48 mean I have these crazy ideas about
02:49 

02:49 homeschooling and so on which my wife
02:52 

02:52 doesn't really support yet. I still have
02:54 

02:54 to prove to her that this can work out.
02:56 

02:56 Um so yeah I just you know and I have
02:59 

02:59 this attitude of um I just want to do
03:00 

03:00 everything myself. That's that's a
03:02 

03:02 little bit of a problem of mine. I'm
03:03 

03:03 very bad at delegating and you know like
03:05 

03:05 putting my child into a child care or a
03:07 

03:07 school that's delegating right. I have
03:09 

03:09 to trust these people to do a good job
03:11 

03:11 with my child. I just can't do that. I
03:13 

03:13 need to do it myself. Um and thankfully
03:17 

03:17 you have the luxury to do it. Yeah.
03:19 

03:19 Maybe another thing that I wanted to say
03:21 

03:21 is
03:22 

03:22 um the paternity leave and maternity
03:25 

03:25 leave in this country is not good. The
03:28 

03:28 politicians if they want if they
03:30 

03:30 constantly rant about the birth rate
03:32 

03:32 being so low, right? It's no wonder man
03:35 

03:35 is so tough. Four months for the woman
03:37 

03:37 and one month for the man. And that's
03:39 

03:39 only if the company allows that. My
03:40 

03:40 company luckily allowed that. I think by
03:42 

03:42 law it's two weeks for the man. and it
03:44 

03:44 can be extended to four weeks now. Um,
03:47 

03:47 that's not enough. That's totally not
03:49 

03:49 enough. Like the first months I was
03:52 

03:52 super hands-on obviously with the baby
03:55 

03:55 and there was there was no second left
03:58 

03:58 to do anything else. And uh if if I
04:00 

04:00 would have to go back to work after just
04:02 

04:02 one month, I have no idea how my wife
04:04 

04:04 would survive at home doing everything
04:05 

04:05 on her own. It's just too much. And then
04:08 

04:08 if you want to do breastfeeding, we want
04:10 

04:10 to do that. You should be doing it for
04:12 

04:12 like up to a year. If you go to work
04:14 

04:14 after four four months already, it's
04:17 

04:17 then you have to do all this crazy stuff
04:18 

04:18 with pumping and you know storing the
04:20 

04:20 milk and oh god it's so complicated. It
04:22 

04:22 would be so much easier if we just stay
04:24 

04:24 at home, right? Yes. In Germany, you get
04:25 

04:25 a whole year and then
04:28 

04:28 um the man could also decide to take
04:31 

04:31 part of that whole year. So then usually
04:33 

04:33 people split up a little bit. Um, and I
04:35 

04:35 think you get a pay cut of course like
04:38 

04:38 60% or so of your salary, but it's
04:41 

04:41 usually still enough to survive for that
04:42 

04:42 year and then focus on the baby. I feel
04:44 

04:44 like that's a way better approach. Time
04:47 

04:47 is just Yeah. People need to have their
04:49 

04:49 minds free and be able to focus on a
04:51 

04:51 child for that incredibly important
04:53 

04:53 first year. And I feel like that's a bit
04:56 

04:56 tough in this country. Yeah. And I'm
04:58 

04:58 very very grateful, of course, that I
05:00 

05:00 can choose to work around that and just
05:02 

05:02 do everything myself. Yeah. Yeah. No, I
05:04 

05:04 I'm so thankful that you as a father
05:07 

05:07 brought up this perspective because
05:08 

05:08 often times this is brought up by
05:10 

05:10 mothers and um when it's too often
05:13 

05:13 brought up by mothers like uh I think
05:15 

05:15 people forget that it's also the fathers
05:17 

05:17 who want to be involved in uh the child
05:20 

05:20 rearing experience as well when we talk
05:22 

05:22 about oh four months maternity leave
05:23 

05:23 that's kind of long but you forget that
05:25 

05:25 four months is also dedicated to
05:27 

05:27 recovery. It's dedicated to things like
05:28 

05:28 breastfeeding which you have to do 24/7
05:31 

05:31 by the way. Yeah. Uh and in Singapore we
05:34 

05:34 also have the culture of confinement.
05:35 

05:35 It's an Asian practice that already
05:37 

05:37 takes that one month and some people
05:39 

05:39 want to do it for longer. So you put all
05:41 

05:41 these factors into place like and then
05:44 

05:44 you only give like the dad two weeks to
05:45 

05:45 a month to participate in this and it's
05:48 

05:48 it's not an option you know it's to make
05:51 

05:51 sure that the mom recovers so that she
05:53 

05:53 can also go back to the workforce as a
05:55 

05:55 whole. I remember my mom telling me that
05:57 

05:57 um when she had me uh she was working at
05:60 

05:60 a bank at that point of time um she uh
06:03 

06:03 because she didn't recover well from a
06:05 

06:05 confinement I had to return to work so
06:06 

06:06 quickly she had so much back aches but
06:09 

06:09 still had to go to work but now she also
06:11 

06:11 had to like fetch us from the daycare
06:13 

06:13 and all of this and my dad was already
06:15 

06:15 trying to put in effort with his shift
06:16 

06:16 work by cooking for us it was very
06:19 

06:19 common for us to eat dinner at 8 and
06:21 

06:21 9:00 p.m. because that that was the only
06:23 

06:23 way we could survive. But you're right
06:25 

06:25 in that Singapore and many Asian
06:27 

06:27 countries are suffering from aging
06:29 

06:29 population. I mean, we turn to
06:30 

06:30 immigration as an easy uh uh fix, but I
06:33 

06:33 don't think that's sustainable in the
06:34 

06:34 long term. When we think about maternity
06:36 

06:36 and paternity, it's about that time.
06:38 

06:38 It's not about giving baby bonuses,
06:40 

06:40 okay? Money can't buy time in this case.
06:42 

06:42 And both parents need to be involved as
06:44 

06:44 much as possible. And I'm not saying
06:47 

06:47 that delegation is bad. We have a lot of
06:49 

06:49 options for child care, infant care, but
06:52 

06:52 as parents, I I feel like the priority
06:54 

06:54 is you want to spend time with your
06:56 

06:56 child and you would love to have the
06:57 

06:57 option if you could. Um, and we don't
06:60 

07:00 really have that flexibility of the
07:02 

07:02 option in Singapore. And you know,
07:04 

07:04 coming back to, you know, I have to talk
07:06 

07:06 about this because we're in women desk
07:07 

07:07 and we also have a lot of these stories.
07:10 

07:10 I think a a major issue is that
07:12 

07:12 companies see this as like a parody
07:15 

07:15 issue. I would definitely want to like
07:17 

07:17 uh pay a man more than a woman because
07:19 

07:19 technically with a woman going on
07:20 

07:20 maternity for four months then a man is
07:23 

07:23 at work like longer. It's it's something
07:26 

07:26 unavoidable. It's biological. And here I
07:28 

07:28 am thinking like I don't think it's
07:29 

07:29 unavoidable. What if you made maternity
07:32 

07:32 and paternity leave mandatory for
07:34 

07:34 example in Germany like they can choose
07:35 

07:35 however. So then there's the risk of the
07:37 

07:37 man just goes away for 6 months and the
07:39 

07:39 companies cannot argue anymore that you
07:41 

07:41 know men are worth more because they
07:43 

07:43 will there will be less potential. Yeah.
07:45 

07:45 Yeah. So because you keep correlating it
07:48 

07:48 to like the woman needs to be at home
07:50 

07:50 and u you know have that four months
07:52 

07:52 then you know exact the same on the man
07:54 

07:54 as well so that he can be involved as as
07:56 

07:56 a dad. I feel like we have so much to do
07:58 

07:58 in this space but I'm so glad you
08:00 

08:00 brought that up and I went on a little
08:02 

08:02 tangent here but I want to go back to uh
08:04 

08:04 you as a father and how are you choosing
08:07 

08:07 to spend that time with uh your child
08:09 

08:09 and I know you have a lot of opinions on
08:11 

08:11 homeschooling so tell us about that.
08:12 

08:12 Yes. I mean, the schooling part is years
08:16 

08:16 down the road still, right? Um, how do I
08:19 

08:19 spend my time as a child? Well, I try to
08:22 

08:22 to give her as many experiences as
08:24 

08:24 possible. Most of the time, of course,
08:25 

08:25 right now is still sleeping. So, she's
08:27 

08:27 we are we are incredibly lucky. She's a
08:30 

08:30 good sleeper. She has been sleeping
08:31 

08:31 since birth, 12 hours per night. So, I
08:34 

08:34 mean, of course, we wake her up in the
08:35 

08:35 middle of the night to feed her. So, we
08:37 

08:37 don't get a whole night. So, I'm still
08:39 

08:39 extremely tired, but uh other parents I
08:42 

08:42 know they have to wake up like every two
08:44 

08:44 hours or whatever. And I don't even know
08:46 

08:46 how they survive. I am already feeling
08:48 

08:48 like I could I can't function at work
08:50 

08:50 with that one little feeling in the
08:52 

08:52 middle of the night. I always wake up as
08:54 

08:54 well, right? It's like my wife beats her
08:56 

08:56 and then I burp her and then I rock her
08:58 

08:58 back to sleep and yeah, but yeah, I mean
09:00 

09:00 I've I've I've read all the Montasauri
09:03 

09:03 books. So that's how I tried um to
09:06 

09:06 establish her childhood later on. And um
09:10 

09:10 um so in her wake time, I try to to to
09:14 

09:14 play with her as much as I can. It's
09:16 

09:16 actually quite remarkable how much you
09:18 

09:18 can already do with her 3 months old. I
09:21 

09:21 feel like at 3 months things are getting
09:23 

09:23 really interesting now. I mean the first
09:27 

09:27 months is just pooping and crying and uh
09:31 

09:31 gastric pains or whatever call it,
09:33 

09:33 right? Uh the second months you can see
09:35 

09:35 all the systems coming online, right?
09:37 

09:37 The the baby starts to grab and and
09:40 

09:40 discover her own fist. It's so cute.
09:42 

09:42 When the hand comes into view, she's
09:44 

09:44 like, "Oh, what's that?" And she stares
09:45 

09:45 at her hand. She goes with her hair
09:47 

09:47 grabbing cob and she cries grabbing her
09:49 

09:49 own hair. Luckily, she has very very
09:51 

09:51 little hair so that cannot happen. But
09:53 

09:53 she pulls my wife's hair. Yeah. So, um
09:57 

09:57 yeah, I've been exposing her to all
09:58 

09:58 kinds of experiences. and whatever I
10:00 

10:00 throw at her few days later she picks it
10:03 

10:03 up like I've bought a professional solo
10:05 

10:05 phone and I thought maybe I'll use this
10:07 

10:07 in a year and then I gave her the stick
10:09 

10:09 of course she tries to eat the stick
10:11 

10:11 right but then I you know guided her
10:12 

10:12 towards the solo phone and she
10:14 

10:14 understands that she can whack the thing
10:16 

10:16 to make sound and she enjoys that for
10:19 

10:19 like 20 minutes people say that babies
10:21 

10:21 don't have an attention span of more
10:23 

10:23 than seven minutes right but I can play
10:25 

10:25 music with her for like 20 minutes so I
10:27 

10:27 think people underestimate children what
10:30 

10:30 kids, even babies, infants can already
10:32 

10:32 do. Um, I wake up and I um uh carry her
10:36 

10:36 out into the sun for some sunbathing and
10:38 

10:38 priming her circadian rhythm. Maybe
10:40 

10:40 that's why she sleeps so well. I don't
10:41 

10:41 know. Uh, I mean, the science says
10:44 

10:44 babies don't have circadian rhythm, but
10:45 

10:45 I don't believe that. Um, when I don't
10:48 

10:48 get out with her at 7:30 in the morning
10:50 

10:50 to soak up the morning sun, if I don't
10:52 

10:52 do that, if sometimes on the weekend we
10:54 

10:54 are lazy like today, then we let her
10:56 

10:56 sleep until 8 or 9 and then it's already
10:58 

10:58 too hot outside to really expose her to
10:60 

10:60 the sun and then she will not fall
11:02 

11:02 asleep at 8. She will, you know, fuss
11:04 

11:04 around until 10 or so, right? So, this
11:07 

11:07 priming definitely works. And um, maybe
11:11 

11:11 mentioning Montasuri, there's this thing
11:14 

11:14 called a topino. Mhm. I have to say
11:16 

11:16 this. This is the most valuable thing
11:18 

11:18 that we have bought for the baby. It's
11:20 

11:20 like
11:21 

11:21 a like a a piece of cloth where the
11:24 

11:24 where the baby can lie on a mat. Um and
11:27 

11:27 it's the cool thing about this is um you
11:31 

11:31 can transfer her from anywhere to
11:33 

11:33 anywhere without her waking up. Right.
11:35 

11:35 Because it's doesn't have the startle
11:38 

11:38 reflex. Yeah. Exactly. As as the infant,
11:40 

11:40 she doesn't have the startle reflex,
11:41 

11:41 right? And and then when people come for
11:43 

11:43 a visit, you can hand her to the next
11:45 

11:45 person. She's like wrapped in a taco
11:47 

11:47 basically, right? She's like she's
11:48 

11:48 wrapped in this thing and you can just
11:50 

11:50 hand her to people. She doesn't even
11:51 

11:51 realize the sleeper sack. Um No, no.
11:54 

11:54 It's it's um how do I You can just Maybe
11:58 

11:58 later in the in the show notes or
11:60 

11:60 whatever you can show a screenshot.
12:01 

12:01 Topon Chino is is the thing. It cost
12:03 

12:03 $130. It might be seem expensive, but
12:06 

12:06 she has literally spent like 80% of her
12:08 

12:08 life on this thing, right? She sleeps on
12:10 

12:10 it and so it has her smell.
12:14 

12:14 Um, whenever we transfer her from the
12:16 

12:16 stroller to her cot or to our bed, she
12:19 

12:19 always is on this thing and and when I
12:22 

12:22 and and so when I when I uh need to rock
12:26 

12:26 her to sleep very often I I I take a
12:28 

12:28 walk at the void deck, right? And um I
12:33 

12:33 carry her on this thing, right? So she
12:35 

12:35 is trained. She knows when she lies on
12:37 

12:37 this she needs to fall asleep and she
12:39 

12:39 will fall asleep within like a few
12:41 

12:41 minutes. Have you tried it on flights?
12:43 

12:43 No, we haven't. We haven't. We haven't.
12:45 

12:45 Oh, I would be interested to know if it
12:46 

12:46 work. I'm I'm pretty sure it works. I
12:48 

12:48 mean, flights have the white noise
12:50 

12:50 around. So, that's actually a perfect
12:51 

12:51 environment already. And yeah, walking
12:53 

12:53 up and down the aisle on this thing will
12:54 

12:54 definitely work. I'm 100% sure about
12:56 

12:56 that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In a geeky way,
12:58 

12:58 I think like when we're talking about
12:59 

12:59 underestimating kids and babies, you
13:01 

13:01 know, babies are like one of the most
13:02 

13:02 accurate LM there ever. Yeah. They're
13:06 

13:06 the best models. And if you think about
13:07 

13:07 the way babies learn, SEMA way uh based
13:11 

13:11 learning, it's the same way that our
13:13 

13:13 models are trained. Maybe one
13:15 

13:15 interesting thing is um I mean I'm very
13:17 

13:17 late uh being a parent. I'm 41, right? I
13:21 

13:21 actually feel like that's one of my
13:23 

13:23 biggest regrets in life actually to not
13:25 

13:25 having a baby 10 years earlier because I
13:28 

13:28 will probably not see my grandchildren,
13:30 

13:30 right? Um I might make it maybe to age
13:34 

13:34 70. I hope these days people seem to die
13:37 

13:37 of cancers and stuff very very young. Um
13:40 

13:40 so I assume my life will be no longer
13:42 

13:42 than 70 just to be sure. So everything
13:44 

13:44 that I need to get done needs to happen
13:45 

13:45 in the next 30 years. Right? And um if
13:47 

13:47 if this trend that women get their
13:49 

13:49 children later and later doesn't change
13:51 

13:51 then my daughter will not get uh
13:55 

13:55 offspring when I'm still alive
13:56 

13:56 potentially. Right? So um and I really
13:59 

13:59 regret that. I I can see that this
14:01 

14:01 family structure that we used to have
14:03 

14:03 where the grandparents help with the
14:05 

14:05 kids is super important. It's otherwise
14:07 

14:07 not possible. You need at least three
14:09 

14:09 people in a household to care for a
14:11 

14:11 child, right? And I mean I'm super lucky
14:14 

14:14 that my mother-in-law lives with us
14:15 

14:15 actually. So there there is a
14:16 

14:16 grandparent there and it's incredibly
14:18 

14:18 helpful. Right. No, I wanted to like ask
14:20 

14:20 like you as like a later parent um and
14:24 

14:24 you having like regrets over the
14:26 

14:26 experience. Would you say that you know
14:28 

14:28 it was your career? No, it it was
14:30 

14:30 actually my worry that we don't have
14:32 

14:32 enough money to have a child in
14:33 

14:33 Singapore. Yeah. And I think that's a
14:36 

14:36 worry for many Singaporeans. Yeah.
14:38 

14:38 Right. Right. Because of rising cost of
14:40 

14:40 living. Yeah. Expensive uh child care.
14:44 

14:44 Yeah. Especially with the four four
14:46 

14:46 month maternity.
14:49 

14:49 talking. Yeah. Yeah. Was it difficult
14:51 

14:51 for your wife also to consider where
14:53 

14:53 that maternity fits into like her
14:55 

14:55 career? You know, all these financial
14:57 

14:57 decisions since we were talking about
14:58 

14:58 finance earlier. I mean, you mean
14:60 

14:60 earlier, 10 years earlier. That's Or you
15:02 

15:02 mean right now? Oh. Oh, right now.
15:03 

15:03 Because you say she's continuing. I
15:05 

15:05 mean, it happened. We wanted it to
15:06 

15:06 happen for years already anyway. So,
15:08 

15:08 when it happens, uh she works at uh at
15:10 

15:10 Hilton.
15:12 

15:12 So, Hilton gets best workplace in the
15:14 

15:14 world all the time. And they really are
15:16 

15:16 a very very good workplace. So uh no
15:19 

15:19 problems at all over there. Yeah. M but
15:21 

15:21 you said it was mostly about the finance
15:23 

15:23 and did you feel like you having to
15:25 

15:25 achieve this stability in terms of being
15:27 

15:27 retired and being able to contribute to
15:29 

15:29 childare? I mean 10 years ago I was much
15:33 

15:33 younger and much more naive and and
15:35 

15:35 worried can I be a good dad while
15:37 

15:37 hustling for startups and you know
15:39 

15:39 that's true like I said the burnout
15:41 

15:41 thing in the open source community is
15:43 

15:43 real right and I felt like I don't have
15:45 

15:45 any time any spare time whatsoever how
15:47 

15:47 how could I possibly care for a child at
15:50 

15:50 this point in my life um now being the
15:54 

15:54 CTO of a company everything is much much
15:57 

15:57 more predictable I I could have
15:60 

15:60 imagined, yeah, I could probably be at
16:01 

16:01 that even while I'm still working. Um,
16:03 

16:03 the fact that I can retire is just me
16:07 

16:07 being super lucky, right? Um, but yeah,
16:09 

16:09 um, still I feel if I had gotten the
16:12 

16:12 child 10 years earlier, I would probably
16:14 

16:14 still have figured out things somehow.
16:15 

16:15 Everybody somehow figures things out
16:16 

16:16 when it happens. And, um, being young
16:19 

16:19 and energetic and healthy, uh, is quite
16:22 

16:22 important, I think, to to raise a child.
16:24 

16:24 Yeah.
16:25 

16:25 Um, can we can we delve into your uh
16:28 

16:28 homeschooling? Right. Yeah. Yeah. The
16:30 

16:30 homeschooling part. Um, yeah. So, like
16:32 

16:32 as everything in my life, I always have
16:33 

16:33 these crazy ideas that are completely
16:36 

16:36 opposite of what everybody else is
16:37 

16:37 doing. By the way, if you do what
16:40 

16:40 everyone else does, then you are
16:42 

16:42 mediocre by definition. You are, you
16:45 

16:45 know, doing what everything else does.
16:47 

16:47 Um, if you want to, if you want to
16:50 

16:50 achieve something outstanding, you have
16:52 

16:52 to do what no one else is doing, right?
16:54 

16:54 Um, so like me coming to Singapore, all
16:57 

16:57 my friends in Germany were saying, "Are
16:58 

16:58 you crazy? I was giving up my my pension
17:01 

17:01 in Germany, right? By not contributing
17:04 

17:04 to the tax system in Germany anymore. So
17:06 

17:06 my my pension will be €300 per month.
17:11 

17:11 I I contributed a few years and so there
17:13 

17:13 is a little bit in my CPF kind of thing
17:15 

17:15 that they have in Germany, right? Um,
17:17 

17:17 but yeah, coming to Singapore, I was
17:19 

17:19 betting on, you know, doing my own thing
17:21 

17:21 here has to work. if it doesn't work, I
17:24 

17:24 will be poor in my old age, right? Um,
17:28 

17:28 so, so when I look at the education
17:32 

17:32 system here, I always hear these horror
17:34 

17:34 stories of children burning out. And
17:36 

17:36 I've actually worked an entire year
17:38 

17:38 using Starbucks, the 20 24-hour
17:40 

17:40 Starbucks in Temp as my office. And I've
17:43 

17:43 been, you know, doing night shifts when
17:45 

17:45 there was deadlines. So, I was working
17:47 

17:47 like from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. or
17:48 

17:48 something like that. And I saw
17:52 

17:52 kids sitting there at 4:00 a.m. studying
17:55 

17:55 for like some final exams that seemed to
17:57 

17:57 come up and I was like, "Wow, this
17:59 

17:59 doesn't happen in Germany. This is like
18:00 

18:00 a culture shock moment for me." So, this
18:03 

18:03 seems to be a very very competitive
18:05 

18:05 education system that you guys have over
18:07 

18:07 here. Um, and I don't even think that it
18:11 

18:11 produces that great people to be honest.
18:14 

18:14 Um, Singaporeans are very very
18:17 

18:17 meticulous, smart about STEM topics for
18:20 

18:20 sure. No questions about that. I mean,
18:23 

18:23 they ace all the international um
18:26 

18:26 Olympics, the math Olympics and all that
18:28 

18:28 all the time, right? Um, but they are
18:32 

18:32 also very risk averse. I feel like
18:34 

18:34 there's usually not much um proactivity
18:37 

18:37 at the workspace and you have to tell
18:39 

18:39 them what to do then they will do it
18:41 

18:41 well. But I would rather have my
18:43 

18:43 employees tell me what they think we
18:45 

18:45 should be doing and then I can give my
18:47 

18:47 wisdom and then let them do it, right?
18:49 

18:49 Um that
18:51 

18:51 would turbocharge our innovation
18:54 

18:54 capabilities, I guess. Um and yeah, I
18:56 

18:56 think Singapore imports the innovative
18:58 

18:58 people quite a bit. And yeah, maybe it's
19:02 

19:02 still a young country and it's going to
19:03 

19:03 somehow solve itself, but I don't see it
19:05 

19:05 really happening. like everybody needs
19:08 

19:08 to be very good at school so that they
19:09 

19:09 get into the best university so that
19:11 

19:11 they can get to work for
19:12 

19:12 DBS. I don't know. I don't see that
19:15 

19:15 future for my daughter. Um so yeah and
19:18 

19:18 then I I we spoke about this earlier
19:20 

19:20 when we had breakfast. Um I saw this
19:22 

19:22 thing called Bloom's two sigma problem,
19:25 

19:25 right? So uh you can Google this blooms
19:27 

19:27 to sigma problem. Click at images then
19:29 

19:29 you see those charts. Basically the idea
19:31 

19:31 is um somebody figured out that if you
19:35 

19:35 move from a classroom setting to mastery
19:37 

19:37 learning um the average student is one
19:40 

19:40 standard deviation better than the
19:42 

19:42 average student in a classroom setting
19:44 

19:44 right and so mastery learning simply
19:46 

19:46 means you only move on to the next topic
19:47 

19:47 when you have mastered the previous
19:48 

19:48 topic which actually Singapore does that
19:51 

19:51 for math that's why Singaporeans are so
19:52 

19:52 good at math internationally um so but
19:56 

19:56 yeah if people say oh I'm not good at
19:58 

19:58 math it's usually not true that
20:00 

20:00 everybody can be good at math. It
20:02 

20:02 probably means that at some point at in
20:05 

20:05 math class they didn't get something and
20:07 

20:07 then class just moved on and they didn't
20:10 

20:10 have the time to catch up and then from
20:11 

20:11 then on you just don't understand math
20:13 

20:13 anymore. Right? But with mastery
20:15 

20:15 learning you you circumvent that
20:17 

20:17 problem. You only move to the next topic
20:19 

20:19 when you have truly mastered the
20:20 

20:20 previous topic. And mastery not learning
20:23 

20:23 by heart and recycling actual
20:26 

20:26 understanding and actual mastery. Right?
20:28 

20:28 I learned everything by heart in school.
20:30 

20:30 I I was extremely good at um road
20:34 

20:34 learning. I was so good that my
20:36 

20:36 classmates asked me um to give them my
20:40 

20:40 print outs, my notes. I I turned every
20:42 

20:42 single topic in school into a vocabulary
20:44 

20:44 test where there's a question and
20:46 

20:46 there's an answer. And then I would
20:47 

20:47 just, you know, cover up the answers and
20:49 

20:49 I read all the questions and I say aloud
20:52 

20:52 out loud the answers. If I'm if I'm
20:54 

20:54 wrong, I start over again. And I just
20:56 

20:56 keep doing that until I force myself to
20:59 

20:59 know all the answers by heart. I aced
21:01 

21:01 the test and the next morning I forget
21:03 

21:03 everything. So like I went through
21:05 

21:05 school learn acing everything but
21:08 

21:08 forgetting everything immediately
21:09 

21:09 afterwards, right? So there's no mastery
21:11 

21:11 and I regret that. Um so I think master
21:14 

21:14 learning makes total sense. It's
21:15 

21:15 intuitive to me that this must be better
21:17 

21:17 than normal normal learning by heart.
21:20 

21:20 And so then and this blooms to sigma
21:23 

21:23 problem. It also turns out if you change
21:25 

21:25 from mastery learning to one-on-one
21:26 

21:26 tutoring, which is homeschooling, then
21:29 

21:29 this the average student becomes two
21:31 

21:31 standard deviations better than the
21:32 

21:32 average student in a classroom setting.
21:34 

21:34 And I mean two standard deviations is
21:35 

21:35 significant, right? Um so yeah, and on
21:39 

21:39 so I feel this makes sense. I'm actually
21:41 

21:41 also a very passionate teacher. I teach
21:44 

21:44 Python at the civil service and um I
21:48 

21:48 used to teach Python at general
21:49 

21:49 assembly. Uh, I just love teaching.
21:52 

21:52 Um, which is probably also the reason
21:54 

21:54 why I do open source because kind of
21:56 

21:56 every time you push source code, you
21:58 

21:58 also teach the rest of the world what
21:59 

21:59 you've just done. Yeah. Um, so I I just
22:03 

22:03 feel I probably can do it. I'm up to the
22:06 

22:06 task to teach. Um, and and then let last
22:09 

22:09 year we have Chity. Thank you for
22:12 

22:12 watching our episode with Martin as we
22:14 

22:14 explore his life as a stay-at-home dad
22:16 

22:16 postretirement as a software engineer.
22:18 

22:18 In the next episode, we'll explore how
22:20 

22:20 AI has changed the future of learning
22:22 

22:22 and how this has influenced Martin's
22:24 

22:24 decision to want to try out
22:25 

22:25 homeschooling for his daughter. Stay
22:27 

22:27 tuned and as always, remember to like,
