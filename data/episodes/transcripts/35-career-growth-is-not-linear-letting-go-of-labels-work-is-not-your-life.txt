00:00 They're already like when you're already
00:02 

00:02 mid engineer, mid-level engineer, right?
00:05 

00:05 You are not sure where else to progress
00:06 

00:06 other than up.
00:07 

00:07 >> I actually do agree that you kind of
00:09 

00:09 start becoming fearful of your identity
00:12 

00:12 as somebody who's very technical and
00:14 

00:14 even now I describe myself as a
00:16 

00:16 technical policy adviser, right?
00:18 

00:18 >> And also like in your case, I would
00:20 

00:20 think uh maybe non-technical people
00:22 

00:22 don't know the advantage of having
00:24 

00:24 technical knowledge.
00:27 

00:27 [Music]
00:29 

00:29 Hello everybody. We are React Tech, the
00:31 

00:31 place for bites and banter. My name is
00:32 

00:32 Natasha. I'm a software engineer,
00:34 

00:34 recently turned tech policy adviser.
00:36 

00:36 Salony, software developer.
00:38 

00:38 >> And I'm Victoria, a solutions engineer.
00:40 

00:40 >> And together we are react. Today's
00:42 

00:42 episode will be all about talking about
00:44 

00:44 how career growth um at least for TAG is
00:47 

00:47 not linear and about the process of
00:50 

00:50 letting go of labels that are tagged to
00:52 

00:52 career growth. uh this topic came about
00:54 

00:54 uh because I think we were talking to
00:56 

00:56 one of our uh friends.
00:57 

00:57 >> So it's actually not just one friend. I
00:59 

00:59 talked to many people recently and they
01:02 

01:02 told me about how they're already like
01:04 

01:04 when you're already mid engineer,
01:05 

01:05 mid-level engineer, right? You are not
01:08 

01:08 sure where else to progress other than
01:09 

01:09 up right other than principal software
01:12 

01:12 engineer. But at some point, a lot of
01:16 

01:16 people that I've talked to who are
01:17 

01:17 mid-level, they told me they're not
01:20 

01:20 really sure if that's the way they want
01:22 

01:22 to go, that's the way they want to
01:23 

01:23 proceed. They want to try something new.
01:25 

01:25 They want to pivot, but doing that
01:28 

01:28 they're afraid that they will lose the
01:30 

01:30 label of being technical
01:32 

01:32 >> because let's say they want to pivot to
01:34 

01:34 product management. A lot of people see
01:36 

01:36 product managers as not very technical.
01:38 

01:38 They don't want to lose that label and
01:40 

01:40 they already selfidentify themselves so
01:42 

01:42 much as a software engineer.
01:45 

01:45 >> So they're like how can I experience new
01:49 

01:49 challenges at work, new kind of diverse
01:52 

01:52 task without feeling like I lost my
01:55 

01:55 identity.
01:56 

01:56 >> So that's why think this topic is
01:59 

01:59 relevant. I think like maybe I'll
02:01 

02:01 comment on this because I as I mentioned
02:03 

02:03 in the intro I recently switched into
02:05 

02:05 more of a tech policy advisor role and
02:09 

02:09 uh I actually do agree that you kind of
02:12 

02:12 start becoming fearful of your identity
02:14 

02:14 as somebody who's very technical and
02:17 

02:17 even now I describe myself as a
02:19 

02:19 technical policy adviser right I really
02:21 

02:21 want that label of being technical
02:23 

02:23 because there's so much fear of that
02:25 

02:25 amount of sunken cost that's one that I
02:28 

02:28 put into honing this very specialized
02:30 

02:30 skill to just kind of lose it like that
02:33 

02:33 through the label.
02:34 

02:34 >> I'm worried about it and it feels like
02:36 

02:36 part of my identity is race so there's
02:38 

02:38 some cost. Two, I think it's this um
02:41 

02:41 like being technical made me feel
02:43 

02:43 competent, you know, like it it made me
02:46 

02:46 feel like I had a skill that nobody else
02:48 

02:48 could easily replace. uh and if I
02:51 

02:51 removed that label, no longer being a
02:53 

02:53 software engineer, no, no longer being
02:55 

02:55 technical and it seemed like I was going
02:57 

02:57 down the generalist path
02:59 

02:59 >> again that also felt uh like something
03:02 

03:02 that was taken away from my identity.
03:03 

03:03 So, I definitely did have like a sort of
03:05 

03:05 crisis transition point. Uh but at least
03:08 

03:08 in my current role, I'm finding ways to
03:10 

03:10 combine both. I did have the culture
03:13 

03:13 shock of coming in and realizing wow um
03:15 

03:15 even though it's tech uh policy work a
03:18 

03:18 lot of it is very non-technical um I
03:20 

03:20 even had this first conversation with uh
03:23 

03:23 my supervisor then I asked him like um I
03:27 

03:27 realized I'm the only uh um technical
03:29 

03:29 person in the entire division do you
03:32 

03:32 feel like there should be more technical
03:33 

03:33 people do you find a use for my uh
03:36 

03:36 technical perspective and I was really
03:38 

03:38 really hoping he would say yes it was a
03:40 

03:40 rhetorical question to boost my
03:41 

03:41 self-confidence.
03:42 

03:42 >> He actually replied that no actually
03:45 

03:45 most of the job is more functional. Uh
03:47 

03:47 he didn't think that there was a need
03:49 

03:49 for a technical perspective and I think
03:51 

03:51 facing the harsh reality of that fact
03:53 

03:53 that there was no need uh for a
03:56 

03:56 technical uh perspective and for my
03:58 

03:58 technical skills in a role it's more of
03:59 

03:59 a bonus that was kind of like a hot
04:02 

04:02 thing for me to sit into. But I think
04:04 

04:04 over time I found a way to kind of blend
04:06 

04:06 both. So um being more technical I could
04:10 

04:10 very easily understand where um like
04:14 

04:14 infrastructure related issues were
04:15 

04:15 discussed at meetings where there was a
04:17 

04:17 lot of boilerplate in terms of like them
04:19 

04:19 explaining this uh issue that came uh
04:22 

04:22 upwards about infrastructure this is
04:24 

04:24 what a container library there was a lot
04:26 

04:26 of discussions up front but I already
04:28 

04:28 intuitively knew what it was so um there
04:31 

04:31 was that benefit of that the other
04:33 

04:33 benefit was right now my I'm actually
04:35 

04:35 helping people automate tasks. I'm
04:38 

04:38 automating tasks using like power apps
04:40 

04:40 on Microsoft. Uh I'm using like chat GPT
04:44 

04:44 uh and trying to teach others as well.
04:46 

04:46 So yeah, I think that's so far how I've
04:49 

04:49 been able to struggle uh that this
04:52 

04:52 crisis uh and these dual identity. Um
04:56 

04:56 again acknowledging that that identity
04:58 

04:58 crisis does exist but trying to find
04:60 

04:60 ways to blend uh the technical side and
05:03 

05:03 see that it brings new perspective to a
05:05 

05:05 role that might not be that technical
05:08 

05:08 >> and also like in your case I would think
05:11 

05:11 uh maybe non-technical people don't know
05:13 

05:13 the advantage of having technical
05:15 

05:15 knowledge
05:15 

05:15 >> right yeah
05:16 

05:16 >> it could just be unawareness
05:19 

05:19 >> yeah yeah actually there's that part too
05:21 

05:21 I think like it's my first timeish being
05:24 

05:24 in like a huge division where I'm like
05:27 

05:27 one of the only few who came from a very
05:29 

05:29 technical background. So obviously I
05:31 

05:31 it's difficult for me to empathize with
05:34 

05:34 um uh the other party party who's
05:36 

05:36 non-technical but yeah it could be a
05:39 

05:39 matter of like they just haven't had a
05:40 

05:40 lot of people who are technical so the
05:42 

05:42 benefits aren't
05:43 

05:43 >> really realized yet. I actually do
05:45 

05:45 understand like uh those people you
05:47 

05:47 spoke to where they coming from as a
05:49 

05:49 engineer I would if I was to lose my
05:52 

05:52 technical skills it would be scary for
05:55 

05:55 me to for example thinking of moving to
05:57 

05:57 product management I feel like tech uh
05:59 

05:59 coding is something that is the special
06:02 

06:02 skill that I have even though it's a
06:04 

06:04 hard skill which anyone can actually
06:06 

06:06 just learn it's just about learning
06:07 

06:07 right practicing learning
06:09 

06:09 >> I feel like that it's a special skill
06:10 

06:10 that I have
06:11 

06:11 >> and if you take that away from me what's
06:14 

06:14 left.
06:15 

06:15 >> So, so I understand the fear of letting
06:17 

06:17 go of the tech tech skills that you
06:20 

06:20 have, the coding skills.
06:22 

06:22 >> No, I like what you said about
06:23 

06:23 envisioning if you take that away from
06:25 

06:25 me, what's left because this is the
06:27 

06:27 whole idea of labels, right? Um, and
06:29 

06:29 honestly, it is a needed exercise. You
06:32 

06:32 need to take something away from
06:34 

06:34 yourself and envision yourself to really
06:35 

06:35 see at the root of it. If coding didn't
06:38 

06:38 exist, your other um like jobs like that
06:41 

06:41 didn't exist. What is your unique value
06:43 

06:43 proposition?
06:44 

06:44 >> Very
06:46 

06:46 part about letting go of labels. If you
06:49 

06:49 couldn't introduce yourself as a
06:51 

06:51 software developer today,
06:53 

06:53 >> who is Salon? Who is Victoria?
06:55 

06:55 >> Just another person.
06:57 

06:57 >> No, that's not the answer. Well, you
06:59 

06:59 obviously have to take this moment and
07:01 

07:01 really sit with it. But you know like um
07:03 

07:03 I I I had like this uh one uh session
07:07 

07:07 with I think junior devs where I was
07:09 

07:09 basically telling people like yeah
07:11 

07:11 labels are just an easy way for you to
07:13 

07:13 introduce yourself to people um in
07:15 

07:15 networking sessions and stuff like that.
07:18 

07:18 But you know at the core of it people
07:20 

07:20 should remember you by not just your
07:22 

07:22 label but like who you are as a person.
07:25 

07:25 You know that flavor that spirit and
07:27 

07:27 that's what makes them come back to you.
07:28 

07:28 It's not that I came back to salon
07:30 

07:30 because she's a software engineer. But
07:32 

07:32 there is a special essence of it and
07:34 

07:34 that selfawareness needs to kick in. If
07:37 

07:37 you didn't have this role uh today, then
07:40 

07:40 >> what do you offer to teams?
07:42 

07:42 >> Yeah, that's why I think like this is a
07:44 

07:44 very interesting question for all of us
07:46 

07:46 to also reflect and think about because
07:48 

07:48 we're we're always labeling ourselves
07:50 

07:50 unconsciously, right? Whether it's true
07:52 

07:52 MBTI
07:54 

07:54 >> or through our LinkedIn titles what we
07:56 

07:56 do, right? We're just we're just a
07:58 

07:58 society that's obsessed with labels
07:60 

07:60 because that's how we can easily
08:02 

08:02 remember people better, right? We
08:04 

08:04 categorize them. It's just easier for
08:05 

08:05 us.
08:06 

08:06 >> So because of that, in return, we label
08:09 

08:09 ourselves, right? And we associated
08:10 

08:10 oursel with all these labels.
08:13 

08:13 >> And for me, I grew up in three different
08:15 

08:15 countries.
08:16 

08:16 >> I cannot find a cultural identity.
08:19 

08:19 Basically, that was my issue growing up.
08:20 

08:20 It's like
08:22 

08:22 >> I don't have a strong cultural identity.
08:24 

08:24 And I noticed I I I think it's a problem
08:27 

08:27 because during the Olympics, right,
08:29 

08:29 Indonesia,
08:29 

08:29 >> you don't know who to support.
08:30 

08:30 >> Indonesia versus Singapore. Then I'm
08:32 

08:32 like,
08:32 

08:32 >> I know. I remember I was like so
08:34 

08:34 confused. 2008 Olympics, uh my helper,
08:38 

08:38 she's pure Indonesian.
08:40 

08:40 >> I'm just cheerful Indonesian. No
08:42 

08:42 hesitation there. But me, I have lived
08:43 

08:43 in Singapore for quite some time and I
08:45 

08:45 even start to use English and I'm like,
08:48 

08:48 >> what am I now?
08:50 

08:50 >> Right. Yeah.
08:51 

08:51 >> So again, I think for this question,
08:54 

08:54 this is the career side of things,
08:56 

08:56 right?
08:57 

08:57 >> I find it a déja vu because I
08:59 

08:59 experienced that growing up cultural
09:02 

09:02 wise. Now I'm experiencing that
09:04 

09:04 career-wise. That's why when you say
09:06 

09:06 take out the technical side, what is
09:08 

09:08 left of me? I think I'm in a better
09:11 

09:11 position than software engineers because
09:12 

09:12 software engineers is like let's face
09:15 

09:15 it, 90% is hard skill. But I came in as
09:18 

09:18 solutions engineer. So it's not I I I
09:21 

09:21 know hard skill is so important but at
09:23 

09:23 the same time I'm not obsessed with that
09:25 

09:25 because I already know that what I'm
09:28 

09:28 good at is I can manage projects
09:32 

09:32 stakeholder communication
09:34 

09:34 >> understanding how to break down task
09:37 

09:37 into smaller milestones and actually
09:39 

09:39 delivering things. So I have many sets
09:41 

09:41 of skills that is not just hard skills.
09:44 

09:44 >> Yeah. So I think like what Natasha said
09:46 

09:46 to let go of labels, you need to be able
09:49 

09:49 to have more than just that skill alone.
09:52 

09:52 You you must be able to really write
09:54 

09:54 down who you are as a person. What other
09:57 

09:57 value can you bring to the table besides
09:59 

09:59 the hard skills? That way even when you
10:01 

10:01 transition cuz I did meet a person who
10:04 

10:04 transitioned from software to product,
10:06 

10:06 they're very okay with it. They still
10:07 

10:07 take pride that I'm a technical product
10:09 

10:09 manager. I'm a product manager. very
10:12 

10:12 technical and it is really a good asset.
10:15 

10:15 >> She don't throw it away. She still keep
10:16 

10:16 it with her but yes maybe people on
10:19 

10:19 first impression do not realize she's
10:21 

10:21 technical but the work will show
10:23 

10:23 eventually.
10:24 

10:24 >> Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I like how you
10:26 

10:26 raised this part. It's that like um
10:29 

10:29 labels are um not as important as like
10:33 

10:33 knowing what you bring to the table. You
10:36 

10:36 need to be very self-aware that beyond
10:38 

10:38 those labels who you are inside at even
10:40 

10:40 where comes a point of time midcareer
10:43 

10:43 you're interested in product management
10:44 

10:44 or you're interested in starting your
10:45 

10:45 own startup that and it could be like a
10:48 

10:48 completely non-technical startup.
10:50 

10:50 >> How do you make that leap? You let go of
10:52 

10:52 your labels first but then you also
10:54 

10:54 address the fact that even after making
10:56 

10:56 that transition that you bring this new
10:58 

10:58 technical perspective because of your
10:60 

10:60 lived experience, right? So that's also
11:03 

11:03 like a great thing to be able to combine
11:05 

11:05 identities and refashion a new identity
11:08 

11:08 for yourself. Not just a product manager
11:09 

11:09 now I'm a technical product manager.
11:11 

11:11 Sure I can't have that on my title per
11:13 

11:13 se but it will show in my work. So I
11:15 

11:15 really like that approach of uh looking
11:17 

11:17 at things as well especially when people
11:20 

11:20 you know are faced with needing to uh
11:22 

11:22 transit careers. I am thinking of a lot
11:24 

11:24 of like uh you know people become moms
11:26 

11:26 for example. I think we have a few of
11:27 

11:27 that in women devs who have had to let
11:30 

11:30 go of being an engineer and then you
11:32 

11:32 know becoming a mom and then re-enter as
11:34 

11:34 a product manager maybe
11:36 

11:36 >> and I always say career growth is not
11:38 

11:38 linear I don't think there's only one
11:40 

11:40 path to growth there's many different
11:43 

11:43 paths and whatever experiences that you
11:45 

11:45 have collected throughout the years it
11:47 

11:47 will really benefit to your current role
11:49 

11:49 because that makes you as a person you
11:51 

11:51 have all these domain knowledge that
11:52 

11:52 >> maybe another person same role as you
11:55 

11:55 will not have cuz they have totally
11:57 

11:57 different experiences. So these
11:58 

11:58 knowledge will overlap, right? And that
12:01 

12:01 would really benefit if you have like if
12:03 

12:03 you can identify how you can synergize
12:05 

12:05 those.
12:05 

12:05 >> Exactly. And I think personally for you
12:07 

12:07 talk a lot about like um you know you're
12:10 

12:10 not just a software engineer, you're
12:11 

12:11 also like a pro uh you have to think in
12:13 

12:13 product. So you're also a product
12:15 

12:15 person. So what you do is you don't see
12:17 

12:17 your career as like linear, you're also
12:19 

12:19 doing things on the side in order to
12:21 

12:21 help uh become a more holistic person.
12:23 

12:23 And one of the what are some of the few
12:25 

12:25 things that you're doing at the site
12:26 

12:26 right now to kind of enhance your role
12:28 

12:28 as a software engineer so you can go
12:30 

12:30 beyond that label?
12:31 

12:31 >> It's okay. You can talk about your side
12:33 

12:33 hustles as well. Okay. Firstly, some
12:36 

12:36 intentional things that I'm doing is uh
12:39 

12:39 speaking like this podcast is one of my
12:42 

12:42 side hustles you can call uh able to
12:45 

12:45 project my voice firstly, able to
12:47 

12:47 express my opinions, uh make
12:49 

12:49 conversations, meet people, things like
12:52 

12:52 that. That's something that's not very
12:55 

12:55 techy tech but it's it's some it's this
12:58 

12:58 skill that you'll have to evolve for
12:60 

12:60 yourself. Okay. So for example I like to
13:01 

13:01 do hackathons with my friends on a
13:03 

13:03 random Saturday right. So it's not even
13:06 

13:06 though it's hackathon yes it's very
13:07 

13:07 technical but before the hackathon
13:09 

13:09 happens you have to actually break down
13:11 

13:11 task into smaller tickets so that
13:13 

13:13 everyone can simultaneously work on
13:15 

13:15 projects and there'll be a MVP at the
13:17 

13:17 end of it. So it's like project
13:19 

13:19 management or you can call it product
13:21 

13:21 management as well. So these are just
13:24 

13:24 skills that one can do on the side to
13:27 

13:27 hone these other aspects of your life
13:29 

13:29 that that want to take away your tech
13:32 

13:32 technical your coding aspect. There are
13:34 

13:34 all these things at your side.
13:37 

13:37 >> Yeah. Yeah. And you also like do some
13:39 

13:39 stuff in e-commerce as well. Spending so
13:41 

13:41 much
13:42 

13:42 >> social media marketing digital
13:44 

13:44 marketing.
13:44 

13:44 >> Yeah. Yeah. Just allowing yourself to
13:46 

13:46 have skills. I think there's this thing
13:48 

13:48 called like uh being a tea skilled
13:50 

13:50 person. You have one very deep skill
13:52 

13:52 like a tea shape and then but then your
13:54 

13:54 whole bread Yeah. Uh you have to have
13:57 

13:57 good breath as well and you're just
13:58 

13:58 growing this tea, right? And I think
14:00 

14:00 that that's more valued in society
14:02 

14:02 nowadays especially since we're talking
14:03 

14:03 more about AI. AI can replace a lot of
14:06 

14:06 like uh certain parts of like that deep
14:09 

14:09 skill. So I guess like if with the
14:11 

14:11 understanding that career growth is not
14:13 

14:13 linear, how you can grow in your career,
14:14 

14:14 you don't have to be more technical as a
14:16 

14:16 person, you can look for other areas to
14:18 

14:18 develop yourself into because who knows
14:21 

14:21 in the future there might be new jobs
14:23 

14:23 that require more of an amalgamation of
14:25 

14:25 these skills. Like for example, just
14:26 

14:26 real quick, when we're talking about
14:28 

14:28 public speaking and like being a
14:30 

14:30 software engineer, it sounds like it'll
14:31 

14:31 never like combine, right? What about
14:33 

14:33 developer relations roles? What about
14:35 

14:35 solutions engineer roles? these roles uh
14:38 

14:38 are also there because they need these
14:40 

14:40 people with very specific combination of
14:43 

14:43 skills.
14:44 

14:44 >> I always believe that like you shouldn't
14:46 

14:46 just be work work shouldn't just be your
14:49 

14:49 entire life. You should have other
14:51 

14:51 endeavors
14:52 

14:52 >> also. It should be I'm I'm not doing
14:54 

14:54 this podcast because I want to uh
14:57 

14:57 increase my public speaking skills. I'm
14:59 

14:59 also doing because it's fun. I get to
15:01 

15:01 speak to my friends
15:03 

15:03 >> while doing these other skills
15:04 

15:04 enhancement. I get to meet these other
15:07 

15:07 passionate technical people in women
15:10 

15:10 deaths also broadening my scope also
15:12 

15:12 making friends
15:14 

15:14 >> uh so it's it's fun to do these things
15:17 

15:17 and also hone these other skills and I
15:19 

15:19 also have you can call it like I have a
15:21 

15:21 life outside of work as well then
15:23 

15:23 >> and I think you find yourself in a good
15:25 

15:25 position where you don't know what to
15:26 

15:26 put in your LinkedIn if you don't know
15:28 

15:28 which label to choose to put in your
15:29 

15:29 LinkedIn I feel like you're in a good
15:30 

15:30 position that means you're a really
15:32 

15:32 diverse person with diverse skill sets
15:34 

15:34 you know so
15:34 

15:34 >> then you're label should be diverse
15:36 

15:36 person
15:37 

15:37 >> honestly like uh like yeah just I'm a
15:40 

15:40 diverse I think some people actually
15:42 

15:42 write such things that you can talk to
15:44 

15:44 me about anything
15:45 

15:45 >> yeah and honestly it's it's totally fine
15:47 

15:47 yeah in fact I feel like our society
15:49 

15:49 might be going more that way we're so
15:51 

15:51 concerned with labels and being
15:52 

15:52 technical because unfortunately that's
15:54 

15:54 the way a capitalist society like
15:56 

15:56 functions right now you know work
15:58 

15:58 corporate you have this designated rule
16:00 

16:00 go for it but life is not that way you
16:03 

16:03 know we're not meant to be pigeonhold
16:05 

16:05 So yeah, I I like the idea of viewing
16:08 

16:08 career growth as like nonlinear. We are
16:10 

16:10 also unintentionally doing it ourselves.
16:12 

16:12 So yeah, we hope this was uh good advice
16:14 

16:14 to anybody out there who might be
16:16 

16:16 sharing in the same struggle of uh kind
16:19 

16:19 of not really knowing uh where you are
16:23 

16:23 if you're midcareer and you might be
16:25 

16:25 looking to transition but you're so
16:27 

16:27 afraid of letting go all the technical
16:29 

16:29 skills that you've built up. But we're
16:31 

16:31 here to tell you that it's you're not
16:33 

16:33 letting it go. you know, you're
16:34 

16:34 basically taking it with you and
16:36 

16:36 modifying the next step of whatever
16:37 

16:37 transition that you're going into. Uh,
16:40 

16:40 and for those who are like in the middle
16:42 

16:42 of your career and still don't know
16:44 

16:44 where you want to transit to, just know
16:46 

16:46 that your career growth is not linear.
16:48 

16:48 You can expand into a variety of
16:50 

16:50 different things. Do things on the side.
16:52 

16:52 Do things that are fun to you. It
16:53 

16:53 doesn't have to be a a course or
16:55 

16:55 something like could be like e-commerce
16:58 

16:58 like you're doing or like a podcast like
16:59 

16:59 we're doing. So yeah, we hope this
17:01 

17:01 episode was helpful to people out there.
17:03 

17:03 And as always, we are Racktag, the place
17:05
