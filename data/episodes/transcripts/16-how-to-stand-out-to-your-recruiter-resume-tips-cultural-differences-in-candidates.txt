00:00 I use that same resume for like a larger
00:02 

00:02 corporation that might not work I might
00:04 

00:04 instead for that same site project need
00:06 

00:06 to say my actual stack like what did I
00:09 

00:09 use and it could go on for like four or
00:11 

00:11 five pages but if you think about it
00:14 

00:14 right what it actually helps a recruiter
00:17 

00:17 is keep it to Max one to two page and
00:20 

00:20 then keep it to that few words that you
00:23 

00:23 have seen in the job description and put
00:25 

00:25 that in is is the fact that you feel
00:28 

00:28 like you don't get enough applications
00:29 

00:29 so you do active reach you attend events
00:32 

00:32 which might be appropriate so it's a
00:34 

00:34 kind of different type of short listing
00:35 

00:35 you're no longer looking at people's
00:37 

00:37 resumes you're talking to them as people
00:39 

00:39 go in as a recruiter people come right
00:41 

00:41 to you and say hey I'm looking out can
00:44 

00:44 you help me can you look at my CVS and
00:47 

00:47 the thing about that is I do want to
00:50 

00:50 help you but I think the intention for
00:53 

00:53 you to come right to like write at me
00:56 

00:56 and tell me I need help and do this I
00:59 

00:59 think that's not appropriate I talk to
01:01 

01:01 the US folks I do see a lot more um
01:05 

01:05 quicker decisions uh whereas in
01:08 

01:08 Singapore it could be a bit slower
01:10 

01:10 because we need to unpack that in a
01:13 

01:13 couple rounds
01:14 

01:14 [Music]
01:17 

01:17 right our friends have been telling us
01:19 

01:19 it's the first round that's hard to get
01:21 

01:21 through which is like when they send out
01:23 

01:23 the applications but they don't get call
01:25 

01:25 backs or hearbs it might be because like
01:29 

01:29 it it it seems like you can't sent the
01:30 

01:30 same resume to the same R again and
01:32 

01:32 again like for example I would tailor my
01:35 

01:35 resume to say for aert up um to be more
01:39 

01:39 like hey I double in these side projects
01:41 

01:41 but I did uh I I tried out like being a
01:45 

01:45 PM and I tried out a little bit of being
01:48 

01:48 a designer but if I use that same resume
01:51 

01:51 for like a larger corporation that might
01:52 

01:52 not work I might instead for that same
01:54 

01:54 side project need to say my actual stack
01:57 

01:57 like what did I use with it would you
01:60 

01:60 say like in your perspective um when you
02:02 

02:02 get all these like the first round of
02:05 

02:05 applications that might be a source of
02:08 

02:08 uh possible conflict for the applicant
02:11 

02:11 where they put it in they're like oh but
02:13 

02:13 I thought my resume was good yeah I
02:15 

02:15 think we did receive uh multiple
02:18 

02:18 candidates applying for roles and
02:20 

02:20 sometimes to be honest when you look at
02:23 

02:23 the CVS them themselves right I mean
02:25 

02:25 they don't actually see the anger as a
02:27 

02:27 what a recruiter will look at so they do
02:29 

02:29 tend to put um or rather they are quite
02:33 

02:33 verbal about what they what they have
02:35 

02:35 achieved in their role and it could go
02:37 

02:37 on for like four or five pages but if
02:39 

02:39 you think about it right what it
02:42 

02:42 actually helps a recruiter is keep it to
02:45 

02:45 Max one to two page if you want you know
02:49 

02:49 maybe you know um make the phone smaller
02:53 

02:53 um you know make sure that it's
02:54 

02:54 everything it's all that you want like
02:56 

02:56 highlight the main part that you want to
02:59 

02:59 you know showcase during this whole
03:03 

03:03 position that you appli for right and
03:05 

03:05 then keep it to that few words that you
03:07 

03:07 have seen in the job description and put
03:10 

03:10 it in right so that's how we actually
03:13 

03:13 first future this candidates as well
03:15 

03:15 there are sometimes that you do uh see
03:18 

03:18 candidates that doesn't really put all
03:20 

03:20 the information that you want but what's
03:23 

03:23 interesting is also you if you do think
03:26 

03:26 that this candidate have potential you
03:28 

03:28 might look Beyond the few pages the
03:31 

03:31 first two pages and you might see
03:33 

03:33 something like uh I I don't know like I
03:35 

03:35 find some of them have really good
03:38 

03:38 experience but they're not putting it
03:40 

03:40 correctly so we're trying to help them
03:42 

03:42 to figure out what do you actually do in
03:45 

03:45 your role but if you're doing a hiring
03:48 

03:48 manager L recruitment means that the
03:51 

03:51 hiring managers are the one that do the
03:53 

03:53 first screening they might just m out
03:56 

03:56 this candidate so there are cases where
03:58 

03:58 some of your friends who might be
03:59 

03:59 looking might have missed out because
04:01 

04:01 they may not be very specific on their
04:03 

04:03 first uh two Lin yeah first two lines or
04:07 

04:07 first page of their their um CVS and we
04:11 

04:11 actually have to go in as a recruiter to
04:12 

04:12 look through again and make sure that
04:14 

04:14 that we actually missed out this person
04:17 

04:17 and then look at their text stack and
04:20 

04:20 see if that makes sense so a lot of
04:23 

04:23 keyword and uh keyword searches for us
04:26 

04:26 to make sure that we do the right thing
04:28 

04:28 right now I wanted to ask about about
04:30 

04:30 the second Channel which is actually
04:31 

04:31 quite interesting because that's
04:32 

04:32 something that we're doing in our
04:33 

04:33 community group now because of the fact
04:35 

04:35 that you feel like you don't get enough
04:36 

04:36 applications so you do active Outreach
04:38 

04:38 you attend events which might be
04:40 

04:40 appropriate so it's a kind of different
04:43 

04:43 type of short listing you're no longer
04:44 

04:44 looking at people's resumés you're
04:45 

04:45 talking to them as people yeah how is
04:48 

04:48 this experience like whether or not it's
04:50 

04:50 technical non-technical when I go for
04:52 

04:52 events my objective is also first to get
04:54 

04:54 the first impression of the person right
04:57 

04:57 not necessarily they are a candidate for
04:59 

04:59 us but it could be a good candidate for
05:02 

05:02 maybe other companies or my friends who
05:05 

05:05 are recruiters themselves who are
05:06 

05:06 looking for candidates as well you're a
05:08 

05:08 big Network as yeah so we do actually
05:10 

05:10 try to share informations as much as
05:13 

05:13 possible to see if that might be a feed
05:15 

05:15 for your company so I think the part
05:18 

05:18 about going events uh and knowing
05:21 

05:21 someone is actually much better than
05:24 

05:24 doing a phone call yeah cuz if you think
05:26 

05:26 about it right a phone call you
05:29 

05:29 basically do a quick initial screening
05:32 

05:32 you don't actually know this person you
05:34 

05:34 don't know what they really do at work
05:37 

05:37 but actually if you spend time just
05:39 

05:39 meeting them in person sitting there and
05:42 

05:42 just figure out how they are as a person
05:44 

05:44 you will also understand or have some
05:47 

05:47 insights into how their Ro really look
05:50 

05:50 like and sometimes meeting them in
05:52 

05:52 person you actually do see a lot more
05:56 

05:56 tangible assets that you might not see
05:58 

05:58 during a phone call right because a lot
06:01 

06:01 of phone calls you do it's very
06:03 

06:03 transactional so we did actually manage
06:05 

06:05 to find really good people who may not
06:08 

06:08 be actively looking out and that those
06:11 

06:11 conversation turn into surprisingly good
06:15 

06:15 conversation that in turn they actually
06:17 

06:17 did interview with some of our companies
06:19 

06:19 or even for my company as well and
06:22 

06:22 that's something really good you know
06:24 

06:24 for for the firm as well you know you
06:26 

06:26 learn a lot more than doing phone calls
06:29 

06:29 I did want to like ask like just a
06:31 

06:31 curious question if there are like in
06:34 

06:34 these networking events where in your
06:36 

06:36 hit you're kind of like looking out for
06:38 

06:38 people to uh possibly recruit are there
06:41 

06:41 certain turn offs that people when they
06:44 

06:44 present themselves that you take not off
06:45 

06:45 cuz I know like for me I remember I had
06:47 

06:47 this experience where I was at like a a
06:51 

06:51 uh it's basically a developer platform
06:53 

06:53 um and they were having an event now and
06:56 

06:56 I think somebody thought I was a
06:58 

06:58 recruiter because I was wearing a Google
06:59 

06:59 Cloud shirt
07:00 

07:00 oh um I'm not from Google CL I just got
07:02 

07:02 this shirt from a hackathon or something
07:04 

07:04 I was wearing it and there was this like
07:06 

07:06 I think she she might have been a first
07:08 

07:08 year student at like one of the
07:10 

07:10 universities here right and she kept
07:12 

07:12 talking to me about her achievements and
07:14 

07:14 stuff like that I was like oh that's
07:16 

07:16 great I was looking I was recruiting for
07:18 

07:18 certain roles for my um organization
07:21 

07:21 then and when I started talking about my
07:23 

07:23 organization I think she immediately was
07:25 

07:25 like oh that's I could see the visceral
07:27 

07:27 change this not really what I'm looking
07:29 

07:29 for and she straight up like just told
07:31 

07:31 me like my aim is to look for like the
07:34 

07:34 big few like the main companies because
07:36 

07:36 my whole plan is like I want to go into
07:38 

07:38 M first and then do that internship for
07:40 

07:40 like one two years and then after that
07:42 

07:42 maybe do a start up and I have like this
07:44 

07:44 robust like uh whatever thing but the
07:47 

07:47 thing is I I thought I was striking a
07:49 

07:49 non-transactional conversation with her
07:51 

07:51 you know I want to get to know you as a
07:53 

07:53 person I don't want you coming in uh
07:56 

07:56 like telling me your CV and stuff like
07:58 

07:58 that I want to get a know you as a
07:60 

07:60 person I think I was immedately just
08:02 

08:02 turned off like the fact that once you
08:03 

08:03 found me um not uh like representing a
08:07 

08:07 company that you thought I was
08:08 

08:08 representing like Okay bye so that was a
08:10 

08:10 turn off for me I was wondering for you
08:12 

08:12 as a recruiter because I don't think you
08:14 

08:14 go around with a recruiter tag right
08:16 

08:16 like hey I'm a recruiter no do you have
08:19 

08:19 certain turn offs that you don't think
08:21 

08:21 like people should be doing if they're
08:22 

08:22 really intentional and trying to get a
08:24 

08:24 job I think because I do attend a lot of
08:26 

08:26 events sometimes I forget that I'm a
08:28 

08:28 recruiter
08:30 

08:30 so I was there really specifically like
08:33 

08:33 just networking and I don't actually
08:35 

08:35 explicitly say that I'm a recruiter at
08:37 

08:37 the start yeah because I do think that
08:39 

08:39 something about your role shouldn't
08:43 

08:43 Define who you are during an uh like an
08:46 

08:46 event as well because if you go there
08:48 

08:48 with that intention that you're are a
08:49 

08:49 recruiter sometimes like what you say I
08:52 

08:52 think they can get a bit aggressive they
08:54 

08:54 could tell you like oh this is my CV
08:56 

08:56 this is what I do how I do it and I I'm
08:59 

08:59 applying for this this and I want to get
09:01 

09:01 into this role right but if let's say
09:04 

09:04 you don't go in with that intention that
09:05 

09:05 you're a recruiter and you're just
09:07 

09:07 meeting them as a person sometimes that
09:10 

09:10 perspective is very different they will
09:12 

09:12 talk to you like a normal human being I
09:14 

09:14 do have some turn off as well but I'm
09:16 

09:16 not going to like name names but I think
09:18 

09:18 there are situations where you go in as
09:21 

09:21 a recruiter people come right to you and
09:24 

09:24 say hey I'm looking out can you help me
09:27 

09:27 can you look at my CVS and the thing
09:29 

09:29 about that is I do want to help you but
09:33 

09:33 I think the intention for you to come
09:36 

09:36 right to like right at me and tell me I
09:39 

09:39 need help and do this I think that's not
09:42 

09:42 appropriate I think it's just you know
09:44 

09:44 understanding and knowing the person
09:46 

09:46 first before you ask for help I think
09:49 

09:49 that's a better way to do it have have
09:52 

09:52 that much decency to like correct yeah
09:55 

09:55 like you know just don't just oh you're
09:57 

09:57 a recruiter I need help yes my C yes
09:60 

09:60 check it please yes yes you probably
10:02 

10:02 wouldn't recommend for people to bring
10:04 

10:04 that CVS to imagining yeah because you
10:07 

10:07 now that I I realized like cuz she
10:09 

10:09 wouldn't be going for events with only
10:12 

10:12 the specific intention I need recruit
10:13 

10:13 for these roles like she's just like oh
10:15 

10:15 maybe I'll meet like other recruiters
10:16 

10:16 maybe I'll meet like other companies
10:18 

10:18 that I want to work with it's just like
10:20 

10:20 open floor whatever but then for like
10:23 

10:23 somebody I guess who's like really
10:25 

10:25 actively recruiting I guess the
10:27 

10:27 perspective is different you're very
10:28 

10:28 intentional I need look for like a
10:30 

10:30 recruiter I need to like know what
10:32 

10:32 they're about so I guess this is this
10:34 

10:34 might be where that this connect is
10:37 

10:37 correct yeah for some people corre yeah
10:39 

10:39 I think when it comes to non-technical
10:42 

10:42 and Technical recruiting I do see that
10:45 

10:45 there's a huge difference when it comes
10:48 

10:48 to non-technical recruiting right people
10:51 

10:51 tend to be
10:53 

10:53 more I think they look at the situation
10:56 

10:56 as well they talk to you as a person
10:58 

10:58 because they want to get your Buy in if
11:01 

11:01 you think about that but when you do a
11:03 

11:03 technical role people can be a bit more
11:05 

11:05 direct not in a bad way I think it's a
11:08 

11:08 good thing but when they're too direct
11:10 

11:10 they don't they tend to forget the
11:12 

11:12 bigger picture around why do you need
11:15 

11:15 you know this support and how can we
11:18 

11:18 help you right because they come in with
11:20 

11:20 the intention that I just want to get my
11:23 

11:23 objective done checked off every day M
11:26 

11:26 yeah definitely oh I did want to ask you
11:29 

11:29 you mentioned that you also do Global
11:31 

11:31 recruiting yes so um I think play across
11:36 

11:36 uh the board um I've heard that there
11:39 

11:39 are differences in people from different
11:41 

11:41 cities people from different cultures
11:43 

11:43 and the way they present themselves
11:44 

11:44 during interviews um from what I
11:47 

11:47 remember in our conversations you've
11:48 

11:48 done a little bit of us and I assume Mo
11:50 

11:50 mostly Asia mostly Asia do you see any
11:54 

11:54 differences um that you will pick out
11:56 

11:56 culturally like across rules yeah I do
11:59 

11:59 think um I mean living in Singapore and
12:03 

12:03 for me Singapore regulations is pretty
12:06 

12:06 good I would say that we have a lot of
12:08 

12:08 regulations that are put out there like
12:11 

12:11 taat and a few other guidelines what you
12:14 

12:14 should what you should not ask but when
12:16 

12:16 it comes to us us recruiting is a whole
12:19 

12:19 lot of things to unpack right cuz you
12:22 

12:22 you're not supposed to ask uh about
12:24 

12:24 their work sponsorship you're not
12:26 

12:26 allowed to ask about their um their some
12:29 

12:29 of their
12:30 

12:30 I guess background and and you you're
12:33 

12:33 actually not allowed to ask a few other
12:35 

12:35 things as well like uh what's your you
12:37 

12:37 know like that there's a lot more
12:39 

12:39 constrained around that so when you
12:41 

12:41 interview someone it has to be very very
12:44 

12:44 um confined to what this role is and how
12:49 

12:49 do we unpack that and typically we try
12:51 

12:51 to be more open right cuz during
12:54 

12:54 interview with um maybe in Singapore
12:56 

12:56 candidates may not be as active like
12:58 

12:58 they don't share a lot things so you ask
13:01 

13:01 more questions more prompting we are
13:02 

13:02 more prompting on that aspect but in us
13:05 

13:05 it's different us people do love to have
13:08 

13:08 uh to to actually um expand into what
13:12 

13:12 they do what they what they actually
13:14 

13:14 have experience in and they can actually
13:16 

13:16 walk you through like how their dayto
13:18 

13:18 day really look like and sometimes it it
13:21 

13:21 probably spends like 30 40 minutes for a
13:24 

13:24 call versus in Singapore maybe maybe a
13:26 

13:26 phone call it could take like 10 minutes
13:29 

13:29 maximum because people are very you know
13:32 

13:32 objective they know what they want to
13:34 

13:34 share specifically into what this will
13:36 

13:36 look like but in us when you recruit you
13:39 

13:39 actually need to you know like when you
13:41 

13:41 ask one question they will tend to share
13:43 

13:43 a lot more right yeah they they like to
13:46 

13:46 share information which is great uh and
13:49 

13:49 sometimes informations that probably
13:52 

13:52 will be very critical for the role could
13:55 

13:55 have already been unpacked during that
13:57 

13:57 interview uh within that phone call as
13:60 

13:60 well whereas in Singapore we have to
14:02 

14:02 break it down into like multiple yeah we
14:05 

14:05 have to prom more multiple stages to ask
14:08 

14:08 such questions and how do we
14:11 

14:11 actually ensure that you know we've
14:14 

14:14 covered all the questions and actually
14:17 

14:17 you know make the right decision to hire
14:19 

14:19 a candidate whereas us I think it's
14:22 

14:22 pretty straightforward people just share
14:24 

14:24 a lot and that's that's great thing
14:26 

14:26 though I I do see that as a a bonus
14:29 

14:29 point
14:30 

14:30 you don't have to ask as many questions
14:32 

14:32 yeah I do I do not ask a lot more
14:34 

14:34 questions because they do tend to know
14:36 

14:36 and I think they they do very well in
14:39 

14:39 interviews actually most of the time
14:41 

14:41 when I interview these candidates like
14:43 

14:43 if they do share a lot they are very
14:46 

14:46 specific and they know what this role is
14:50 

14:50 they tend to actually Excel really well
14:52 

14:52 and right from the get go you know that
14:54 

14:54 they're going to get a job so sometimes
14:57 

14:57 you have that feeling that actually I
14:59 

14:59 mean I shouldn't say gut feeling but we
15:03 

15:03 do have that as well as a recruiter that
15:05 

15:05 we do see that oh if you do actually
15:08 

15:08 share such an information that is so
15:11 

15:11 useful for this role typically we think
15:13 

15:13 that right if when we share this to the
15:15 

15:15 home managers they do buy that in and
15:19 

15:19 most of the time they do get the role so
15:22 

15:22 50% of my time when I talk to the US
15:25 

15:25 folks I do see a lot more um quicker
15:29 

15:29 positions uh whereas in Singapore it
15:32 

15:32 could be a bit slower because we need to
15:34 

15:34 unpack that in a couple rounds right so
15:37 

15:37 need to understand the individual is
15:39 

15:39 this parallel to like your experience
15:41 

15:41 because I know like your company is uh
15:43 

15:43 International you have like uh the US
15:46 

15:46 side as well um would you say that this
15:49 

15:49 is what you see of your us colleagues as
15:52 

15:52 well like uh definitely they are a lot
15:55 

15:55 more vocal than my local peers uh
15:60 

15:60 but yeah I never like looked at it from
16:02 

16:02 a recruitment perspective I mean they
16:03 

16:03 were just colleagues and I always just
16:05 

16:05 saw them as yeah they're a bit more
16:07 

16:07 expressive and more vocal and they they
16:10 

16:10 are the ones who usually bring in more
16:12 

16:12 like oh how was a weekend you know the
16:13 

16:13 start off a stand up kind of things uh
16:17 

16:17 but yeah but that's interesting that you
16:19 

16:19 know even in recruitment it does help
16:21 

16:21 them actually that they're able to to
16:24 

16:24 speak they're able to express their
16:25 

16:25 thoughts and still being on point there
16:29 

16:29 yeah I mean not not necessarily always a
16:31 

16:31 point you did point out like sometimes
16:33 

16:33 yeah but you would say that might be
16:35 

16:35 real they do they do as well sometimes
16:38 

16:38 that you do see that as a red flag as
16:40 

16:40 well so you you don't you don't you
16:42 

16:42 don't go all all out because I think
16:45 

16:45 ultimately when it comes to interviewing
16:48 

16:48 there's a set of way to do it so we tend
16:51 

16:51 to ask them you know specifically that
16:54 

16:54 during this interview we'll start off
16:56 

16:56 usually like we we'll we'll spend maybe
16:58 

16:58 the 20 minutes to you know uncover your
17:01 

17:01 experience your background and then you
17:03 

17:03 know we can set way into what this world
17:06 

17:06 looks like so we want to cover that in
17:09 

17:09 that 20 minutes call so we try to set
17:11 

17:11 the agenda at the start at all
17:13 

17:13 interviews but of course you know when
17:16 

17:16 it comes to you know interview as you
17:19 

17:19 know more of a conversation you you turn
17:22 

17:22 out it turn out that you know sometimes
17:24 

17:24 they do speak longer than 20 minutes so
17:26 

17:26 we we need to be very you know
17:29 

17:29 confin into what we want to share and
17:32 

17:32 ask them that please let's just discuss
17:34 

17:34 this first and then we can go back there
17:36 

17:36 if we need to right right yeah basically
17:38 

17:38 kind of achieve that balance but it's
17:41 

17:41 just kind of interesting having this
17:42 

17:42 perspective because like a another
17:45 

17:45 controversial but kind of like an Open
17:46 

17:46 Secret almost is that like especially as
17:49 

17:49 singaporeans or like people in Asia if
17:52 

17:52 you were to go up against an
17:54 

17:54 international candidate a lot of them
17:55 

17:55 Americans or from like Europe they tend
17:57 

17:57 to have like an edge but we you don't
17:59 

17:59 know what this Edge is and it just
18:00 

18:00 becomes like this angry frustration
18:02 

18:02 maybe they're just picking like you know
18:04 

18:04 the whole single par tend to say oh they
18:06 

18:06 always choose forers over usse but it's
18:08 

18:08 not so much I think it's about the way
18:09 

18:09 of presentation I think the skill set um
18:12 

18:12 I take it as an equilibrium it's all the
18:14 

18:14 same but it's about the way we present
18:16 

18:16 and U this goes into a lot of like
18:18 

18:18 cultural values that we're trained to
18:20 

18:20 but now You' really put it in that
18:21 

18:21 recruiter perspective that oh they tend
18:23 

18:23 to like be more automatic when it comes
18:26 

18:26 to like really sharing and delving
18:27 

18:27 deeper into their experiences so there's
18:29 

18:29 less prompting but uh for like a um
18:32 

18:32 Asian uh Singapore based candidate you
18:35 

18:35 might have to do more work in terms of
18:36 

18:36 prompting you have to the decisions come
18:39 

18:39 a little bit slower because you're like
18:41 

18:41 okay he might have said this but like
18:43 

18:43 what did they actually mean do we need
18:44 

18:44 to come back with another interview to
18:46 

18:46 ask more like you're really trying to
18:48 

18:48 like I want to see your potential so I
18:50 

18:50 think these are things that we could
18:52 

18:52 really really learn from especially with
18:54 

18:54 now you know you're we're we're not just
18:57 

18:57 looking at pure applications and
18:58 

18:58 interviews as Al the Outreach part of it
19:01 

19:01 going to events and stuff like that I
19:02 

19:02 think that soft skill do play into more
19:05 

19:05 of a bigger picture and we hope to be
19:07 

19:07 able to like bring this perspective in
19:09 

19:09 an objective manner um both in our women
19:12 

19:12 in Tech communities as well as a wider
19:14 

19:14 Tech Community I think these insights
19:16 

19:16 have been really really helpful uh I
19:19 

19:19 think all in all this is really good for
19:21 

19:21 both of us yeah I mean happy to be here
19:24 

19:24 as well I mean thanks for inviting me as
19:26 

19:26 well I think it's really great to
19:28 

19:28 understand from both your perspective
19:30 

19:30 not just you know as a recruiter because
19:32 

19:32 you need to understand what the other
19:35 

19:35 person is actually thinking of and how
19:37 

19:37 do they actually perceive recruiting as
19:39 

19:39 well yeah exactly yeah I think there is
19:42 

19:42 like a really a disconnect and now I've
19:44 

19:44 really realized where it is and there's
19:46 

19:46 a lot more to unpack but I hope like
19:48 

19:48 this episode really helps people
19:49 

19:49 understand that that it's not about
19:51 

19:51 who's better or worse but it's just like
19:53 

19:53 there is a difference in that
19:54 

19:54 perspective and we hope to bring you
19:56 

19:56 again for like the next episode um

20:06 

20:06 of her more global perspective as well
20:08 

20:08 as like more generalist recruitment
20:10 

20:10 perspectives onto the table so that we
20:12 

20:12 can help everyone both not just in the
20:14 

20:14 Tech Community but beyond the Tech
20:16 

20:16 Community as well yeah so as always this
