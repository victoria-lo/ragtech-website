00:01 [Music]
00:05 

00:05 supped to tell her on the phone how to
00:07 

00:07 write code I'm like uh you know function
00:11 

00:11 fibon bracket bracket open bra oh my go
00:15 

00:15 go to an event and find out who are the
00:17 

00:17 good people out there who may not be
00:19 

00:19 obviously on LinkedIn as well so wanted
00:21 

00:21 to know from your perspective does that
00:24 

00:24 uh actually make a person stand out that
00:26 

00:26 this person does side projects related
00:28 

00:28 to their work outside work or do you
00:31 

00:31 think that's not really necessary they
00:33 

00:33 should also have a life
00:36 

00:36 maybe hello everyone welcome to R Tech
00:39 

00:39 I'm Salon a software developer I'm
00:41 

00:41 Natasha also a software developer and
00:43 

00:43 today we have Joanna a recruiter and
00:46 

00:46 today's episode is going to be all about
00:48 

00:48 recruitment hi I'm Joanna I'm a talent
00:51 

00:51 acquisition manager so perhaps a start
00:54 

00:54 off Joanna would you like to tell us
00:55 

00:55 about what a talent acquisition manager
00:58 

00:58 is and what your role is y so maybe can
01:00 

01:00 start off so basically I am working for
01:03 

01:03 a venture capital firm and I have been a
01:06 

01:06 talent acquisition manager for the last
01:09 

01:09 three years and before that I was doing
01:10 

01:10 recruitment for about close 5 years so
01:13 

01:13 in total about eight years so what a
01:15 

01:15 talent acquisition manager does is not
01:18 

01:18 just on recruiting can be a lot more
01:20 

01:20 than recruiting so first of course you
01:23 

01:23 know when you want to do recruitment you
01:24 

01:24 need to do sourcing so you need to find
01:27 

01:27 good candidates for the role and also
01:29 

01:29 secondly you will actually need to do a
01:31 

01:31 lot of the backend work so it's not just
01:33 

01:33 the frontend work where you do all the
01:36 

01:36 calling of the candidates finding the
01:37 

01:37 right candidate but you actually need to
01:39 

01:39 transpose them into informations where
01:42 

01:42 you can actually present them to your um
01:45 

01:45 your hiring managers as well as for your
01:48 

01:48 managers as well to understand what the
01:50 

01:50 recruitment process look like right so
01:52 

01:52 just to clarify the hiring manager and
01:53 

01:53 the talent acquisition specialist is
01:56 

01:56 different yes it is actually different
01:58 

01:58 so a lot of time people people have
02:01 

02:01 mistakenly you know used both this words
02:05 

02:05 um yeah correct because a lot of time
02:08 

02:08 they think that recruiters are basically
02:10 

02:10 doing recruiting only the word it's
02:13 

02:13 basically recruitment right but actually
02:16 

02:16 as a talent acquisition what it means if
02:18 

02:18 you break down it's Talent acquire right
02:21 

02:21 so meaning you need to acquire good
02:23 

02:23 talent but in order to do that you need
02:25 

02:25 to actually look at all different
02:28 

02:28 segment of it so not just on finding
02:31 

02:31 candidates where as an external agency
02:34 

02:34 you just look for good candidates
02:36 

02:36 whereas for internal roles you actually
02:38 

02:38 do a lot more towards you know finding
02:41 

02:41 candidates making sure that they feed
02:43 

02:43 the cultural feed and also understanding
02:46 

02:46 what the requirements are as a firm and
02:50 

02:50 the business needs so it's a lot more
02:52 

02:52 than hiring and also just looking at you
02:55 

02:55 know doing interviews and stuff like
02:57 

02:57 that so if you're talking about
02:59 

02:59 acquisition would you say that you will
03:01 

03:01 be the first bar like that first round
03:03 

03:03 where people send in like their CVS and
03:05 

03:05 stuff like that you're the one who like
03:07 

03:07 filters that yes correct so I do all the
03:10 

03:10 futuring of the candidate so I do Global
03:13 

03:13 recruiting actually so my role here it's
03:17 

03:17 um not just you know looking at
03:18 

03:18 candidates that apply from the website
03:21 

03:21 so typically or recruitments right if
03:24 

03:24 you were to have a new role you will
03:25 

03:25 actually advertise it externally but we
03:28 

03:28 don't actually only post stood there but
03:30 

03:30 we actually do a lot of Outreach to
03:33 

03:33 candidates so a lot of co- reaching out
03:35 

03:35 of candidates doing a lot of um say you
03:39 

03:39 know like um finding out you know if
03:42 

03:42 there's any events related to this role
03:45 

03:45 yeah how can you actually look into that
03:47 

03:47 go to an event and find out who are the
03:49 

03:49 good people out there who may not be
03:52 

03:52 obviously on LinkedIn as well so you
03:54 

03:54 actually have to do that as well so the
03:56 

03:56 role is quite varied but I think the
03:59 

03:59 good thing about um what we do here is
04:02 

04:02 basically finding the best candidate as
04:04 

04:04 well best talent that feeds into the uh
04:08 

04:08 the the company's culture as well so
04:10 

04:10 that's that's something that I do a lot
04:12 

04:12 as well right right because in your role
04:14 

04:14 you're not just doing internal
04:16 

04:16 recruitment you're also recruiting for
04:17 

04:17 the portfolio companies under your
04:20 

04:20 larger company so that's why it's more
04:22 

04:22 of like you also have to match correct
04:24 

04:24 the company values to the candidate so
04:26 

04:26 when it comes to like really looking at
04:28 

04:28 a candidate we're not just like looking
04:30 

04:30 at pure credentials right yes yeah
04:32 

04:32 you're looking at things like alignment
04:34 

04:34 to company values which I've always
04:36 

04:36 found is kind of like kind of vague if
04:39 

04:39 you think about it and how how do you do
04:41 

04:41 that because first you need to
04:42 

04:42 understand the company values then
04:45 

04:45 second you have to somehow be able to
04:48 

04:48 identify these values at the first cut
04:51 

04:51 at the second cut like how how do you do
04:52 

04:52 this like such a vague and complex term
04:56 

04:56 so for me I think what's important is
04:60 

04:60 for the first C you actually need to I
05:02 

05:02 mean before that even that process can
05:05 

05:05 happen you need to actually sit down
05:07 

05:07 with the hiring manages to actually
05:09 

05:09 understand what this role looks like
05:10 

05:10 first right because ultimately there are
05:13 

05:13 two ways as well to do it it doesn't
05:15 

05:15 mean that all recruiters have to see
05:17 

05:17 into all first round interviews um not
05:20 

05:20 necessary there are times where there
05:22 

05:22 are hiring uh managers let Recruitment
05:24 

05:24 and there are times that we do it as a
05:26 

05:26 recruiter Le uh interviews so meaning
05:29 

05:29 that if we doing recruiter interviews
05:31 

05:31 means that we are the first person that
05:33 

05:33 they do uh meet uh as an initial round
05:36 

05:36 to actually test out and understand uh
05:39 

05:39 basically what the requirements are for
05:41 

05:41 this role and all the way up to say you
05:44 

05:44 know some technical questions as well
05:46 

05:46 we're not technical I have to say but we
05:48 

05:48 do actually um implement or rather get a
05:52 

05:52 g of what the JG are for the specific
05:55 

05:55 role and we actually in integrate or in
05:59 

05:59 um improvise that into our interview
06:01 

06:01 questions as well so every role is
06:03 

06:03 different yeah so if let's say I were to
06:06 

06:06 do um the first round I would typically
06:09 

06:09 try to figure out what this role looks
06:11 

06:11 like first with the hire manager and
06:13 

06:13 break it down into two parts and
06:16 

06:16 understand what is required as a
06:18 

06:18 recruiter to uh engage with these
06:20 

06:20 candidates about before I move them to
06:23 

06:23 the next round so that's basically what
06:25 

06:25 I do here yeah yeah that's interesting
06:28 

06:28 because you brought up the term J and
06:30 

06:30 having to understand the role with the
06:32 

06:32 hiring managers first and I think
06:35 

06:35 because like selon and I you know were
06:37 

06:37 software engineers and obviously there's
06:39 

06:39 a lot of jogging yeah I mean like a
06:42 

06:42 Salone would have more experience at
06:43 

06:43 recruiting than I would so I actually
06:46 

06:46 remember this one time uh I spoke to a
06:49 

06:49 recruiter a tech recruiter I mean tech
06:52 

06:52 recruiter asent she was recruiting me as
06:54 

06:54 a software developer so tech recruiter
06:56 

06:56 but uh so she had no technical knowledge
06:58 

06:58 but she actually did ask me technical
07:00 

07:00 question at the end of the first round
07:03 

07:03 of interview which was just a HR phone
07:05 

07:05 call so she did ask me actually uh how
07:08 

07:08 would you implement the
07:09 

07:09 Fibonacci uh oh she asked that yeah the
07:12 

07:12 the
07:13 

07:13 Fibonacci program and she asked me on
07:16 

07:16 the phone so I'm actually supposed to
07:18 

07:18 tell her on the phone how to write code
07:21 

07:21 I'm like uh you know function fibon
07:25 

07:25 bracket bracket open braces oh my go I'm
07:28 

07:28 like is that the level cuz I didn't know
07:30 

07:30 what how how do I do this with you who
07:32 

07:32 doesn't understand what I'm saying it's
07:34 

07:34 true so and I don't know what is she
07:36 

07:36 writing what I'm saying or it was a bit
07:38 

07:38 weird but it was like five to six lines
07:41 

07:41 of code that I told her I told her the
07:44 

07:44 oh she even asked me is it recursive or
07:46 

07:46 is it not she she knew that much so then
07:49 

07:49 at the end of it I didn't ask her sorry
07:51 

07:51 that was new to me like uh saying out
07:54 

07:54 code on the phone did you understand it
07:57 

07:57 or she's like no I just have to relay
07:60 

07:60 this information back to the hiring
08:01 

08:01 manager so I got what I wanted she
08:04 

08:04 didn't ask me the recursive non like she
08:06 

08:06 she knew some jargons I don't know if
08:08 

08:08 she knew what it meant but she noted
08:10 

08:10 down things it was it was new to me but
08:13 

08:13 I think I was like in awe of it because
08:17 

08:17 that actually makes sense because she
08:19 

08:19 did say that uh it's been it's because a
08:22 

08:22 lot of people applied to us and a lot of
08:24 

08:24 them I realized at the second round at
08:26 

08:26 the coding round that they don't know
08:27 

08:27 how to code then you're wasting the
08:30 

08:30 the interviewer's time correct so
08:32 

08:32 therefore she did the first level of
08:34 

08:34 filtering by asking this question and if
08:38 

08:38 you knew how to c you would be able to
08:39 

08:39 answer something exactly so then I was
08:41 

08:41 like wow okay so someone actually like
08:44 

08:44 told her to like ask this question to
08:46 

08:46 filter out people so I understand what
08:48 

08:48 you mean by you understand like the
08:51 

08:51 criteria and then try to filter as much
08:54 

08:54 as possible at your level yes but I I'm
08:57 

08:57 guessing as a general uh gen General
09:00 

09:00 recruiter you would know about so many
09:02 

09:02 different roles in your firm right so
09:04 

09:04 not just Tech you would also have uh
09:07 

09:07 product
09:08 

09:08 management uh uxui designer yeah
09:11 

09:11 there'll be different kinds of filtering
09:13 

09:13 for each of the different departments I
09:15 

09:15 would say so would you have to like
09:18 

09:18 learn yeah yeah actually you do side by
09:21 

09:21 side maybe yes that's a very good
09:24 

09:24 question actually so because I'm a
09:26 

09:26 generalist in where I am right now so I
09:29 

09:29 typically do all kinds of roles I could
09:31 

09:31 do anything from a business development
09:34 

09:34 role to a sales role to an operations
09:37 

09:37 role a legal role could be anything
09:40 

09:40 right but if you're talking about uiux
09:42 

09:42 and previously I was looking for a full
09:46 

09:46 stack developer that's actually very
09:47 

09:47 different as well right so if you want
09:49 

09:49 to look at recruiting right like what
09:51 

09:51 youve just mentioned earlier it's
09:53 

09:53 actually very similar to my experience
09:55 

09:55 because I am not a technical person I
09:58 

09:58 was not brought up in that environment
10:00 

10:00 um but of course I did expose myself
10:03 

10:03 into that space which is why I had some
10:05 

10:05 experience understanding it but before I
10:08 

10:08 can get into that I also want to maybe
10:09 

10:09 break down as well on two parts I think
10:12 

10:12 when you mentioned earlier right about
10:13 

10:13 your experience speaking to a recruiter
10:16 

10:16 that's something that I need to do as
10:17 

10:17 well so of course I would say that when
10:20 

10:20 it comes to technical recruiting or
10:22 

10:22 rather your product management or your
10:25 

10:25 UI uh designers you typically get a ton
10:28 

10:28 of candidates H whereas for a technical
10:32 

10:32 role a very very technical role where
10:34 

10:34 you talk about full step developers your
10:36 

10:36 software Engineers I don't see that
10:39 

10:39 demand in that space yeah so if you look
10:43 

10:43 into two parts right actually UI ux and
10:45 

10:45 product management roles are more um
10:49 

10:49 simplified you don't actually have to go
10:50 

10:50 into all the Jons the technical front of
10:54 

10:54 it like what do you build you don't
10:56 

10:56 actually need to go into that space But
10:58 

10:58 you do actually need to understand what
11:01 

11:01 are some of the projects that you have
11:03 

11:03 covered you have done whereas on the
11:05 

11:05 part where you're looking at software
11:06 

11:06 engineers and all that you basically
11:08 

11:08 have to ask questions like that whereas
11:10 

11:10 we don't understand right but what I do
11:12 

11:12 is before I do this uh call with a
11:15 

11:15 candidate I do the intake of the hiring
11:17 

11:17 managers I say show me how do you do
11:20 

11:20 this and what do you do with that so
11:22 

11:22 that's how I actually gain insight into
11:25 

11:25 how this role would look like and when
11:27 

11:27 candidate ask me how is is going to
11:30 

11:30 translate into their career trajectory
11:33 

11:33 that's something that I would actually
11:34 

11:34 speak about as well so it's quite
11:36 

11:36 interesting that um when as a recruiter
11:39 

11:39 that doesn't have technical experience
11:42 

11:42 we don't actually just sit on it and say
11:44 

11:44 Hey you know let's just figure out
11:45 

11:45 ourself but we actually do ask a lot of
11:48 

11:48 this questions to the H managers and say
11:51 

11:51 look let me understand help me
11:54 

11:54 understand in a way actually how do I
11:56 

11:56 actually speak to this candidates and
11:59 

11:59 understand what this project looks like
12:01 

12:01 what is the end goal of it and what's
12:03 

12:03 the objective of this yeah so the
12:06 

12:06 recruiting exercise is pretty lengthy so
12:10 

12:10 if you were to look at I mean going back
12:11 

12:11 to you know like recruiting in technical
12:14 

12:14 roles I typically don't see a lot of
12:18 

12:18 candidates applying so typically we have
12:21 

12:21 like less than 100 applicants that comes
12:23 

12:23 in to our system but what we do is we do
12:26 

12:26 a lot of Outreach because it's so
12:28 

12:28 specialized into technical experience
12:31 

12:31 skill set we do work with the hiring
12:33 

12:33 managers to figure out what is required
12:35 

12:35 for the role then we'll actually reach
12:37 

12:37 out to them and speak to them about that
12:40 

12:40 so that will take a lot of our time off
12:42 

12:42 you know from interviewing candidates to
12:45 

12:45 the part where they move on to the
12:47 

12:47 coding exercise so the coding exercise
12:49 

12:49 is all curated and created based on what
12:52 

12:52 the role requirements are so it's very
12:55 

12:55 different from what you may have
12:57 

12:57 experienced in your corporate role or
12:59 

12:59 even in you know your your other roles
13:02 

13:02 right so I think that's something that
13:04 

13:04 we do typically see that um it's a good
13:08 

13:08 challenge to understand that they are
13:10 

13:10 right feed so we spend like hours you
13:13 

13:13 know creating this projects um this case
13:16 

13:16 use cases as well that would make sense
13:19 

13:19 for candidates and then translate that
13:21 

13:21 into a proper coding you know exercise
13:24 

13:24 to see if they are the right feet yeah
13:26 

13:26 so that's actually a lot of work and
13:28 

13:28 sometimes when you do
13:31 

13:31 interview hundreds of candidates
13:34 

13:34 ultimately sometimes they're not the
13:36 

13:36 right fet it's really going back to you
13:39 

13:39 know where you started off right and
13:41 

13:41 trying to understand this whole cycle
13:43 

13:43 again right so yeah I just find it very
13:45 

13:45 interesting because the whole Insight
13:47 

13:47 that you have to interview the hiring
13:49 

13:49 manager first like as a recruiter before
13:53 

13:53 interviewing the candidates like this is
13:55 

13:55 completely foreign to me but it actually
13:56 

13:56 makes a lot of sense if you think about
13:58 

13:58 it you know the fact that had asked him
13:60 

13:60 like specifically in this role like what
14:03 

14:03 what certain jargon that I should
14:05 

14:05 understand could you explain it to me
14:07 

14:07 and then you design like the perhaps
14:09 

14:09 some sort of simplified case study that
14:10 

14:10 you could ask the candidate that's kind
14:13 

14:13 a lot of work on you because like I
14:15 

14:15 couldn't imagine like say like the
14:16 

14:16 example that Salone brought up the uh
14:18 

14:18 Fibonacci exercise yeah I I will be I I
14:23 

14:23 would feel a bit stunted if I had to
14:25 

14:25 verbally ask that question also and then
14:27 

14:27 have to feel a bit lost when the
14:29 

14:29 candidate is like going through pseudo
14:31 

14:31 quote line by line and I I can can I
14:36 

14:36 imagine like that kind of experience for
14:38 

14:38 you like constantly having to learn new
14:39 

14:39 things especially now um in Tech you get
14:42 

14:42 more and more Diversified roles now with
14:44 

14:44 like the AI busz obviously you have you
14:47 

14:47 know you have to know the difference
14:48 

14:48 between a data scientist and a data
14:50 

14:50 engineer now you have what's the
14:53 

14:53 difference between a prompt engineer
14:54 

14:54 versus like an AI engineer there's so
14:56 

14:56 many things you know and even we
14:59 

14:59 struggle to understand that so how has
15:01 

15:01 that process been for you knowing that
15:04 

15:04 like you know even something as simple
15:05 

15:05 as like like simple to us only because
15:07 

15:07 we're in a field full SE developer
15:09 

15:09 versus front end and back end honestly
15:11 

15:11 like uh we get these questions a lot but
15:13 

15:13 I still struggle to explain it to people
15:16 

15:16 so how do you like try as a recruiter
15:19 

15:19 try to level up yourself um with like
15:22 

15:22 the changes in the tech industry to try
15:24 

15:24 to understand this that that's something
15:27 

15:27 that I thought through a lot I I think
15:29 

15:29 even before this um conversation right I
15:32 

15:32 did think about it as well when we do
15:34 

15:34 recruit people of that of experience
15:37 

15:37 actually to be fair we don't know
15:40 

15:40 exactly what this role look like because
15:42 

15:42 if we're talking about AI Engineers
15:44 

15:44 versus a fullstack developer they are
15:46 

15:46 very different as well right the skill
15:48 

15:48 sets are different you look at someone
15:50 

15:50 that may have perhaps data science
15:52 

15:52 experience and there are some that
15:54 

15:54 doesn't have data science as well so I
15:56 

15:56 would say that uh we do break it down
15:59 

15:59 we're look at exactly what the scope of
16:01 

16:01 R looks like first and we actually
16:04 

16:04 understand what are the skill sets or
16:06 

16:06 whether the technical skill sets are
16:08 

16:08 required for this rule before we get
16:10 

16:10 into it but similarly now because we
16:12 

16:12 have chat GPT as one key tool that we
16:16 

16:16 use on a daily basis if you look at that
16:19 

16:19 um sometimes we don't need someone that
16:21 

16:21 has all the experience but what this
16:23 

16:23 person needs is a very good soft skill
16:26 

16:26 that actually understands what the
16:28 

16:28 business requirements are and actually
16:31 

16:31 understands how they as a individual
16:34 

16:34 able to build a similar app or similar
16:38 

16:38 tool that could be you know useful for
16:40 

16:40 the business so for instance I think for
16:44 

16:44 all cases um I think a lot of the
16:47 

16:47 companies that I know as well some of
16:48 

16:48 the companies that we invested in as
16:50 

16:50 well um they do have uh struggles as
16:53 

16:53 well finding the right feat of
16:55 

16:55 candidates but what they need is someone
16:57 

16:57 that is intellect actually um you know I
17:01 

17:01 would say they are very stimulated in in
17:04 

17:04 their sense of understanding of what
17:06 

17:06 their role looks like and what this role
17:08 

17:08 may be and they actually need to
17:11 

17:11 translate that in a way where if they
17:13 

17:13 don't have that skill set they will go
17:15 

17:15 out there and actually look for
17:17 

17:17 resources to support them right so the
17:19 

17:19 resourcefulness is something that you're
17:21 

17:21 looking for so you're really looking
17:22 

17:22 more for like when I talk to this
17:24 

17:24 candidate I might not understand a lot
17:26 

17:26 of the technical stuff they're saying
17:27 

17:27 but their ability to even translate that
17:30 

17:30 to you to be able to pick up that you
17:32 

17:32 are a general recruiter how am I going
17:34 

17:34 to translate this into the business
17:36 

17:36 requirements you're asking for how am I
17:38 

17:38 going to like relay this I guess these
17:40 

17:40 are also things that we talk about a lot
17:43 

17:43 in our podcast as well realizing that
17:46 

17:46 being a software engineer is not just
17:48 

17:48 being able to code right it's really
17:51 

17:51 understanding understanding the product
17:52 

17:52 be able to articulate as well so I mean
17:55 

17:55 I'm very happy to hear that that's like
17:57 

17:57 a important part of is your company's
18:00 

18:00 recruitment yes cor it makes a lot of
18:03 

18:03 sense because like you I I am not
18:05 

18:05 venturing to understand every language
18:08 

18:08 in the world you know but I pride myself
18:11 

18:11 in being like an engineer who you know
18:13 

18:13 you can give me different syntaxes but
18:15 

18:15 at the end of the day I am very
18:17 

18:17 confident to be able to translate uh
18:19 

18:19 whatever the uh user needs in whatever
18:22 

18:22 syntax needed because I understand
18:24 

18:24 design patterns I understand like what
18:26 

18:26 companies large or small scale need and
18:29 

18:29 I guess being able to explain that to
18:30 

18:30 you in a Layman uh fashion that you can
18:33 

18:33 easily take away and translate it back
18:35 

18:35 to your hiring manager yeah it's it's
18:37 

18:37 very useful to you yeah correct this is
18:40 

18:40 really making me think of a lot because
18:41 

18:41 I think a lot of our friends in the tech
18:44 

18:44 industry do spend I would say they spend
18:46 

18:46 more time lead coding than actually
18:48 

18:48 practicing the soft skills which I know
18:50 

18:50 you talk a lot about but at the same
18:52 

18:52 time it's very hard to explain what
18:54 

18:54 these self skills are I think that's why
18:56 

18:56 you emphasize a lot in doing uh
18:59 

18:59 interviews like interview as much as you
19:01 

19:01 can because it's only through talking to
19:02 

19:02 like people like yourself and other uh
19:04 

19:04 different recruiters that you keep
19:06 

19:06 practicing the skill of like okay I need
19:07 

19:07 to keep explaining this and explaining
19:09 

19:09 that yeah correct so that's something
19:12 

19:12 that we do very often as well there are
19:14 

19:14 times that we could possibly be reaching
19:17 

19:17 out to candidates who are not actively
19:20 

19:20 looking for a new role so if you think
19:22 

19:22 about that right you sitting at that
19:24 

19:24 position where this person is not
19:26 

19:26 looking and reaching out they tend to be
19:28 

19:28 more t because you're not actually
19:30 

19:30 actively looking for a new role so you
19:33 

19:33 actually need to First figure out what
19:35 

19:35 the intention is and how we can actually
19:38 

19:38 guide them and give them tips and tricks
19:40 

19:40 so that they can actually move on in
19:42 

19:42 their recruitment process right so
19:44 

19:44 typically as a talent acquisition person
19:48 

19:48 we don't actually need to give them a
19:50 

19:50 lot of guiding tools as well but what we
19:52 

19:52 can do is we give them resource
19:54 

19:54 resources online to say hey you can do
19:57 

19:57 this read up on this but as as a
19:59 

19:59 recruiter you will actually need to go a
20:02 

20:02 extra M to actually break down what this
20:05 

20:05 Ro looks like and how you should
20:07 

20:07 actually communicate that during an
20:09 

20:09 interview not saying that you have to
20:10 

20:10 change the way you speak but rather be
20:13 

20:13 more in the way that it helps you to
20:16 

20:16 formalize how this role looks like and
20:19 

20:19 how you can actually contribute because
20:21 

20:21 you only have say a 20 minutes or 30
20:24 

20:24 minutes call with a the hiring manager
20:26 

20:26 so that 20 minutes you need to
20:28 

20:28 encapsulate every
20:29 

20:29 that you wants to share based on this
20:32 

20:32 role and actually understand if this is
20:34 

20:34 a right match for you as well and how do
20:37 

20:37 you actually provide that insight into
20:39 

20:39 how your role is sometimes like I
20:42 

20:42 mentioned we don't look at people that
20:43 

20:43 have the light to light of experience
20:45 

20:45 but what we look at is the soft skill
20:47 

20:47 how do you actually you know build um
20:50 

20:50 that experience or do you do that
20:52 

20:52 outside of your your day job as well
20:54 

20:54 right like do you build your own app do
20:56 

20:56 you do something um outside of your Norm
20:59 

20:59 so things like that we ask very good
21:01 

21:01 questions as well to stimulate them and
21:04 

21:04 allow them to uh to actually uh showcase
21:07 

21:07 that during the interview so that's
21:08 

21:08 something that I do notice that
21:11 

21:11 candidates that comes in more prepared
21:14 

21:14 in that aspect they do Ace to interview
21:17 

21:17 much better than the ones that are not
21:19 

21:19 oh it's very interesting I want to ask
21:22 

21:22 like uh we did talk about this in one of
21:23 

21:23 our other episodes where I was talking
21:26 

21:26 about how doing site projects are
21:28 

21:28 important I want to know from like your
21:30 

21:30 perspective like as as me as a software
21:33 

21:33 iite projects one one thing one of the
21:37 

21:37 reason I do it is to stand out from the
21:39 

21:39 others that I do not just code at work I
21:42 

21:42 also code 5 to nine after my 9 to5
21:45 

21:45 something like this and also of course
21:47 

21:47 I'm interested in building something
21:48 

21:48 that can help in my day-to- day but I
21:50 

21:50 wanted to know from your perspective
21:52 

21:52 does that uh actually make a person
21:54 

21:54 stand out that this person does side
21:56 

21:56 projects related to their work outside
21:59 

21:59 work or do you think that's not really
22:01 

22:01 necessary you should also have a life
22:05 

22:05 maybe well I think there's two sides of
22:09 

22:09 it right you can see that as one you are
22:12 

22:12 actually spending a lot of time trying
22:14 

22:14 to build your Skuse set or hold your
22:16 

22:16 skus as well right but there are another
22:19 

22:19 site where you're spending so much time
22:21 

22:21 you know where you're not focusing on
22:23 

22:23 your your maybe work life balance or
22:26 

22:26 you're not focusing on your own life
22:28 

22:28 right I think there's a good s for that
22:31 

22:31 if you do actually spend time doing your
22:33 

22:33 own projects you do actually gain the
22:36 

22:36 advantage when you go for interview
22:38 

22:38 because what I would say generally what
22:41 

22:41 hiring managers are looking for are
22:43 

22:43 people that are proactive they're not
22:46 

22:46 they're not just you know confined into
22:48 

22:48 what their daily tasks are but there are
22:50 

22:50 someone who is curious minded wants to
22:53 

22:53 venture out into something else wants to
22:56 

22:56 build that
22:57 

22:57 entrepreneurial um
22:59 

22:59 mindset in in their but that really
23:01 

23:01 depends on the company as well what I'm
23:04 

23:04 speaking about it's based on my
23:06 

23:06 experience and some of my companies that
23:09 

23:09 we invested in I guess cuz most of the
23:12 

23:12 companies under your belt are also
23:13 

23:13 startups at that stage so to look out
23:16 

23:16 for um traits like proactiveness
23:19 

23:19 resourcefulness is obviously like more
23:22 

23:22 um uh relatively more important for a
23:24 

23:24 startup because maybe the role requires
23:26 

23:26 them to be like more flexible less um
23:29 

23:29 like the dictative like role so it have
23:32 

23:32 to be very fluid if you were to be
23:34 

23:34 working in a startup whereas if you work
23:37 

23:37 in a huge corporate you know Society you
23:41 

23:41 probably would see that there's not a
23:43 

23:43 need where you need to be very
23:45 

23:45 specialized into multiple areas where I
23:49 

23:49 think a lot of times if you were to work
23:51 

23:51 for big corporate they tend to look at
23:53 

23:53 very Silo experiences and they tend to
23:57 

23:57 hire people like that because they like
23:59 

23:59 part of that whereas for a startup they
24:02 

24:02 want someone that is comfortable to
24:04 

24:04 double into multiple tools and projects
24:08 

24:08 and and even though they don't have that
24:10 

24:10 technical skill they will want that
24:13 

24:13 person to actually build up their
24:15 

24:15 experience or their exposure into that
24:17 

24:17 space so not necessarily you need to
24:20 

24:20 have it but if you do site projects like
24:23 

24:23 that it actually do showcase that you're
24:25 

24:25 someone that is very versatile you're
24:27 

24:27 able to you know wear multiple heads oh
24:31 

24:31 that's actually interesting because we
24:32 

24:32 did like you know the conversation about
24:34 

24:34 startups versus like larger corporations
24:37 

24:37 like what's the difference we talk about
24:39 

24:39 what's the difference working in there
24:40 

24:40 but we've never talked about the
24:42 

24:42 difference from a recruiter's
24:43 

24:43 perspective when I recruit but I guess
24:45 

24:45 going down to like the value sets you're
24:47 

24:47 looking at it makes sense that in a
24:49 

24:49 startup you want somebody who um is more
24:52 

24:52 Diversified you know um it's more
24:54 

24:54 proactive in trying different things so
24:57 

24:57 when they talk about their side projects
24:59 

24:59 you're looking out for things like um
25:01 

25:01 you you've tried this out and that out
25:03 

25:03 different roles different stacks and
25:05 

25:05 stuff like that and that resourcefulness
25:07 

25:07 to like find different solutions would
25:09 

25:09 be important to like a startup but
25:12 

25:12 perhaps like not saying that site
25:13 

25:13 projects aren't important for recruiting
25:15 

25:15 for larger companies but in those type
25:17 

25:17 projects you might want to look at more
25:19 

25:19 like I use this type project to double
25:21 

25:21 in this specific skill set would you say
25:23 

25:23 that correct so you're you're trying to
25:25 

25:25 elucidate different things and it's not
25:27 

25:27 so much about the quantity the projects
25:29 

25:29 right correct about what did you take
25:31 

25:31 away from it corre imagine yeah and
25:34 

25:34 sometimes when we interview these
25:36 

25:36 candidates we actually dive even deeper
25:39 

25:39 into why they decided to start this site
25:41 

25:41 project so not necessarily about their
25:44 

25:44 day job sometimes it's all about like
25:45 

25:45 what they do outside of their work as
25:47 

25:47 well and figuring out why they do this
25:50 

25:50 and what is the whole idea about it like
25:53 

25:53 why do you um start something like that
25:56 

25:56 you know so a lot of times we kind of
25:59 

25:59 see another Anger from their perspective
26:02 

26:02 and we do see whether or not they are a
26:04 

26:04 potential candidate that could be a good
26:07 

26:07 fit to the company and as well as
26:10 

26:10 looking at whether or not if they are
26:12 

26:12 resilient enough to actually do multiple
26:15 

26:15 things or even to work with you know the
26:18 

26:18 senior stakeholders right within the
26:20 

26:20 firm right because not necessarily
26:22 

26:22 sometimes you need to build everything
26:24 

26:24 within a day or two but you actually do
26:27 

26:27 need to actually speak to to your
26:29 

26:29 stakeholders and actually convince them
26:32 

26:32 what this whole idea is so we do tend to
26:35 

26:35 look at multiple um angle and also
26:39 

26:39 looking at how this would actually
26:41 

26:41 translate that during uh the interview
26:43 

26:43 as well and we take all this information
26:46 

26:46 we furnish this to our hiring managers
26:49 

26:49 to give them a whole report about what
26:51 

26:51 this candidate could be uh could be
26:54 

26:54 their strengths and what are some of the
26:57 

26:57 probably not cons but more of what are
26:59 

26:59 self areas of development for them as
27:01 

27:01 well so we do actually also take this uh
27:04 

27:04 to candidates sometimes uh to actually
27:07 

27:07 show them like what are some areas that
27:09 

27:09 you might missed out during interview
27:12 

27:12 that could be yeah could be useful not
27:14 

27:14 necessarily all of them I because we do
27:16 

27:16 have like thousands of candidates if you
27:19 

27:19 were to look at the process right but we
27:21 

27:21 do try to be intentional if let's say we
27:24 

27:24 do have good feedbacks from the hiring
27:26 

27:26 managers we do want to share that with
27:28 

27:28 the candidates as well because I do
27:30 

27:30 understand that interviewing is very
27:32 

27:32 lengthy so we want to make sure that
27:34 

27:34 they get the best out of it and
27:36 

27:36 hopefully their next interview they will
27:38 

27:38 score really well and hopefully they get
27:40 

27:40 you know they get a good role as well
27:42 

27:42 for themselves yeah yeah
