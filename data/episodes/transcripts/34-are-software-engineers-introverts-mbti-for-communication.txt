00:00 There's this party trick I do at at
00:03 

00:03 meetups where I'll be like, "Hey,
00:05 

00:05 Victoria, meet Natasha.
00:07 

00:07 Guess her MTR." She can actually tell
00:10 

00:10 you your entire personality. That's
00:11 

00:11 that's Victoria's uh secret.
00:17 

00:17 Hello everyone. We are Reg, the place
00:19 

00:19 for bites and banter. I'm Natasha, a
00:22 

00:22 software engineer, recently turned tech
00:23 

00:23 adviser.
00:24 

00:24 Salony, software developer,
00:26 

00:26 and I'm Victoria, solutions engineer.
00:28 

00:28 And today we're going to be talking
00:30 

00:30 about MBTI and answering a question, are
00:32 

00:32 engineers mostly introverts? So we
00:35 

00:35 actually came up with this topic because
00:36 

00:36 we have a resident MBTI expert who
00:39 

00:39 explain to us what MBTI is. So Victoria
00:43 

00:43 is actually the resident expert here.
00:45 

00:45 Yes, I am. So MBTI is basically
00:47 

00:47 MyersBrigg type indicator. It stands for
00:50 

00:50 that. Um most people also know it by 16
00:54 

00:54 personalities. So because there's four
00:57 

00:57 letters in MBTI that describe your
00:60 

00:60 personality and there's 16 different
01:02 

01:02 combinations. So that's what it's
01:04 

01:04 essentially about. But before we get
01:06 

01:06 deeper, I just want to disclaimer that
01:10 

01:10 you know there's no such thing as only
01:12 

01:12 16 personalities and people are not
01:15 

01:15 boxed into 16 personalities. So I prefer
01:18 

01:18 calling it MBTI because MBTI also talks
01:22 

01:22 about the cognitive functions
01:24 

01:24 which later we can
01:25 

01:25 yeah I think a lot of people forget
01:26 

01:26 about the cognitive functions and focus
01:29 

01:29 a lot about the extrovert introvert part
01:31 

01:31 right personality
01:32 

01:32 just the four letter that describes this
01:34 

01:34 person's whole personality which it's
01:37 

01:37 not right so that's why I think calling
01:40 

01:40 it MBTI is more accurate because it
01:42 

01:42 looks deeper than just you know labeling
01:45 

01:45 yourself into these four letters.
01:49 

01:49 What are these four four letters? Can
01:50 

01:50 you just explain?
01:51 

01:51 Yeah. So the four letters, the first one
01:53 

01:53 extraversion or introversion. So E or I.
01:57 

01:57 Second one intuition or sensing. Third
01:60 

01:60 one is thinking or feeling. And then the
02:02 

02:02 fourth one judging versus perception.
02:06 

02:06 So each of these letters kind of like
02:08 

02:08 other personality kind of frameworks
02:10 

02:10 like ocean and all that. Each of these
02:12 

02:12 letters describe your tendency
02:14 

02:14 to behave or think a certain way.
02:17 

02:17 So for example, E versus I. That that's
02:19 

02:19 the easiest people would get, right?
02:21 

02:21 Extroversion versus introversion.
02:23 

02:23 So another myth is introversion doesn't
02:26 

02:26 mean you're shy.
02:28 

02:28 Extroversion doesn't mean you're
02:30 

02:30 outgoing.
02:31 

02:31 The difference is extroversion means you
02:34 

02:34 recharge when you're around people. And
02:37 

02:37 then for introversion means you recharge
02:39 

02:39 when you're by yourself.
02:42 

02:42 But it doesn't mean like I'm an
02:43 

02:43 introvert. It doesn't mean like I hate
02:45 

02:45 people.
02:46 

02:46 I'm antisocial.
02:48 

02:48 There's nothing about that. I think a
02:49 

02:49 lot of people misconception about you
02:52 

02:52 know extroversion introversion.
02:53 

02:53 Yeah. Yeah.
02:54 

02:54 Yeah. And I think there's also the
02:55 

02:55 common misconception of people think
02:57 

02:57 that engineers are mostly introverts.
02:60 

02:60 But with this new reframing that
03:02 

03:02 introverts just um they don't
03:04 

03:04 necessarily uh gain energy from talking
03:07 

03:07 to people like what do you think about
03:08 

03:08 this conception actually are you an
03:10 

03:10 introvert yourself? I mean we're all
03:11 

03:11 engineers sitting here like you're
03:13 

03:13 I'm like a 90%
03:15 

03:15 introvert. There also this there's also
03:17 

03:17 this thing called introverted extrovert.
03:20 

03:20 M
03:20 

03:20 I think I've heard of this and I think
03:22 

03:22 I'm there like yes I I I get my energy
03:26 

03:26 by being alone by myself but I also
03:28 

03:28 enjoy being with people and I like
03:30 

03:30 presentation for example I like podcast
03:33 

03:33 like I'm speaking out loud right now
03:36 

03:36 uh that's also fun so so it's it's
03:39 

03:39 called like introverted extrovert
03:40 

03:40 it's not really an MBTI the concept of
03:42 

03:42 like extroverted introvert is there
03:45 

03:45 exclusively for MBTI only there's other
03:48 

03:48 personality frameworks that uses
03:49 

03:49 introvert version and extraversion like
03:51 

03:51 for example the big five the ocean right
03:54 

03:54 that that also
03:55 

03:55 I don't know what that is also
03:56 

03:56 oh okay I think
03:57 

03:57 so that's why you're the resident expert
03:59 

03:59 right
03:59 

03:59 cuz ocean stands for like openness
04:02 

04:02 conscientiousness
04:03 

04:03 extraversion agreeableness neotism
04:06 

04:06 right right
04:07 

04:07 so the ocean framework is also
04:09 

04:09 describing there's a extraversion part
04:11 

04:11 in there right but again extraversion
04:14 

04:14 doesn't mean see like you said you like
04:16 

04:16 speaking you like talking to people you
04:17 

04:17 like hanging out it doesn't mean that
04:19 

04:19 you are an extrovert, right? If you
04:22 

04:22 still
04:23 

04:23 in order to recharge your energy, your
04:25 

04:25 soul,
04:26 

04:26 yeah, I need to go.
04:27 

04:27 You have to spend time alone,
04:29 

04:29 it it just means you're introvert,
04:30 

04:30 right? That means you just need to
04:32 

04:32 recharge by yourself.
04:33 

04:33 And there's many ways of recharging,
04:35 

04:35 right? And of course, it's not like you
04:37 

04:37 only like people are in a spectrum.
04:40 

04:40 It doesn't mean like oh, you're
04:41 

04:41 introvert means you only recharge by
04:43 

04:43 spending time alone. I also can recharge
04:45 

04:45 spending time with my closest people.
04:47 

04:47 Right. Right. It's dependent on like
04:49 

04:49 people.
04:49 

04:49 Yep. Some some people do not drain that
04:52 

04:52 energy from you. So it's actually
04:53 

04:53 intact.
04:54 

04:54 Yeah. Yeah. Or sometimes even talking
04:56 

04:56 with someone helps you gain
04:57 

04:57 and elevate it. Yeah.
04:58 

04:58 Yeah. So it just means in general your
05:01 

05:01 spectrum you lie on this means you tend
05:04 

05:04 to like to spend time alone to recharge
05:06 

05:06 but it doesn't mean
05:08 

05:08 it's you only do that and it's always
05:10 

05:10 you only do that.
05:11 

05:11 Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. And also
05:13 

05:13 like just going back since like you're
05:15 

05:15 an introvert you would consider yourself
05:16 

05:16 an extroverted introvert. Introverted
05:19 

05:19 introverted introverted
05:20 

05:20 introverted.
05:21 

05:21 Yeah. And then like myself actually a
05:24 

05:24 lot of people think I am just probably
05:26 

05:26 100% extroverted. I did test to be an
05:28 

05:28 extrovert on uh the MBTI test but that
05:30 

05:30 was years ago. I would actually consider
05:32 

05:32 myself to be what I call a professional
05:34 

05:34 extrovert. I do need a lot of time to
05:37 

05:37 recharge and usually if you see the
05:39 

05:39 cadence of my public appearances once I
05:42 

05:42 appear in public to do a public speaking
05:44 

05:44 event super extroverted but then I kind
05:46 

05:46 of tone down for the next month because
05:48 

05:48 I need to recharge. So I guess like if
05:51 

05:51 we go back to like the myth are
05:52 

05:52 engineers introverts I would say I I
05:55 

05:55 think there might be like a greater
05:56 

05:56 tendency perhaps it might be a nature of
05:58 

05:58 work I'm not really sure but you know if
06:01 

06:01 that's a myth that people are interested
06:02 

06:02 in this is our statistical analysis the
06:05 

06:05 three people sitting in front of you are
06:07 

06:07 mostly introverted I guess but it's not
06:11 

06:11 saying that we're going to be
06:12 

06:12 pigeonholder that because the fact that
06:13 

06:13 we're sitting before you and speaking
06:16 

06:16 you know despite being like perhaps uh
06:18 

06:18 having a greater tendency to be
06:20 

06:20 introverted just means that yeah that's
06:22 

06:22 just our tendency but we can do things
06:23 

06:23 too but I wanted to go back to like why
06:25 

06:25 you're a resident expert like what got
06:27 

06:27 you interested in studying personality
06:29 

06:29 types is it because of your other things
06:31 

06:31 you have to do in your field of work
06:33 

06:33 yeah because every day I have to
06:35 

06:35 communicate with nontechnical people and
06:37 

06:37 technical people right and there's a
06:39 

06:39 huge difference like statistically like
06:42 

06:42 in terms of communication style when
06:44 

06:44 talking with nontechnical and technical
06:47 

06:47 people and I just find it easier easier
06:49 

06:49 if I know what is their MBTI then I can
06:53 

06:53 cater my communication style to them
06:56 

06:56 that way it's easier for them to
06:58 

06:58 understand what I'm saying it's easier
06:59 

06:59 for me to convey what I'm saying and
07:01 

07:01 it's easier for us to just you know
07:03 

07:03 two-way communication cuz I would
07:06 

07:06 understand them they would understand me
07:07 

07:07 and so on so I think I use MBTI as a
07:10 

07:10 framework uh more like a guidance not
07:12 

07:12 like a you know 100% boxing people into
07:15 

07:15 the these but more like
07:17 

07:17 let's say this person is um they're more
07:20 

07:20 receptive and understanding if I appeal
07:24 

07:24 from the emotional side.
07:25 

07:25 Yeah.
07:26 

07:26 Right. Then I can start out my pitch
07:28 

07:28 being like, you know, talking about, oh,
07:31 

07:31 feelings, humans, right?
07:33 

07:33 Or like even us
07:34 

07:34 feelings humans
07:37 

07:37 versus robots.
07:39 

07:39 No, no, cuz some people are more more I
07:43 

07:43 I'm naturally more pivoted towards data,
07:46 

07:46 right, analytics, like I I need to see
07:49 

07:49 like concrete data. But some of them
07:51 

07:51 they might prefer like what is the
07:53 

07:53 meaning behind this? What's the deeper
07:54 

07:54 meaning? like in a broader perspective
07:57 

07:57 like for the customers for the users
07:59 

07:59 right they they care more about that
08:01 

08:01 so then I'll start off with that or even
08:04 

08:04 building rapport first I'll start off
08:05 

08:05 with how was your week how was your day
08:08 

08:08 because some people they they want that
08:10 

08:10 personal feelings first
08:12 

08:12 and then then they can work with the
08:14 

08:14 person well where some people they're
08:16 

08:16 just more you know just tell me what I
08:18 

08:18 need to do
08:19 

08:19 and and be done with it
08:20 

08:20 more objective so actually where does
08:22 

08:22 this land and is it the end or
08:25 

08:25 uh so again it's not the letter itself
08:27 

08:27 it's the cognitive functions
08:30 

08:30 okay right
08:31 

08:31 like as a whole what it means
08:33 

08:33 that personality
08:35 

08:35 there's many there's yeah so again it's
08:37 

08:37 very complicated
08:39 

08:39 it's like the cognitive function itself
08:40 

08:40 so so cognitive functions are things
08:43 

08:43 that describe how you process
08:46 

08:46 information and how you think through
08:48 

08:48 that information and how you communicate
08:51 

08:51 it
08:52 

08:52 so for me as an example I am INTJ. So
08:55 

08:55 what does that mean cognitive function
08:57 

08:57 wise is Ni. So my first dominant
08:60 

08:60 function N I means I look at patterns. I
09:03 

09:03 observe people based on patterns and I
09:05 

09:05 look for deeper meaning. So let's say
09:07 

09:07 there's a movie, right? I would always
09:09 

09:09 think about what's the underlying
09:11 

09:11 meaning or message.
09:12 

09:12 Right. Right. Do you search up the
09:14 

09:14 synopsis like after and see? Sometimes
09:16 

09:16 I'll look up like what is the symbolism
09:18 

09:18 or the meaning of certain motives that I
09:20 

09:20 will see keep appearing in the movie
09:22 

09:22 like certain symbolism. I wonder what
09:24 

09:24 does that mean
09:25 

09:25 you know like I'm curious to find out
09:27 

09:27 like after I see patterns like that's
09:29 

09:29 how I think and then my second cognitive
09:33 

09:33 function TE extroverted thinking so that
09:36 

09:36 led me to be more rational and logical
09:38 

09:38 than compared to like other people
09:40 

09:40 because based on what I see the patterns
09:42 

09:42 the Ni after that I'll apply it with my
09:45 

09:45 logic my TE I'll apply it with like okay
09:47 

09:47 so how does this fit into the logic of
09:50 

09:50 this world
09:52 

09:52 basically so that's like my thought
09:53 

09:53 process usually.
09:55 

09:55 Yeah, it's like it can go very very
09:57 

09:57 deep. Um, so that's why uh based on
10:01 

10:01 cognitive functions, it helps me
10:03 

10:03 structure how I should communicate to
10:05 

10:05 this person. It is part of my PE also,
10:08 

10:08 you know, it's like I see this person
10:10 

10:10 has a certain tendency. So I look for
10:11 

10:11 patterns in this person's behavior and
10:13 

10:13 thought process and then I use my TE to
10:16 

10:16 like logically come out with a solution
10:18 

10:18 to cater to this person.
10:20 

10:20 Right? for you it's just like input
10:22 

10:22 output
10:24 

10:24 some people
10:25 

10:25 basically a computer
10:26 

10:26 does that's why growing up people do
10:28 

10:28 describe me as robotic right because
10:31 

10:31 that's how I process information kind of
10:33 

10:33 like that
10:34 

10:34 I've also received that feedback
10:36 

10:36 growing up that am I robotic but I'm not
10:39 

10:39 I mean not in your terms
10:42 

10:42 but maybe some thinking
10:43 

10:43 maybe there's different definitions yeah
10:45 

10:45 so that's how I essentially use MBTI as
10:48 

10:48 like a guidance to work in teams,
10:51 

10:51 communicate, resolve conflicts, uh even
10:54 

10:54 manage teams. But of course, that's not
10:56 

10:56 the only thing I look at because again,
10:59 

10:59 you don't pigeon hole people. They It's
11:01 

11:01 all in a spectrum. They just
11:03 

11:03 It's a guide, right? It's a guide. It's
11:04 

11:04 a guide. And I guess it's a good
11:05 

11:05 starting point for people who are
11:07 

11:07 intimidated about working in teams. In
11:10 

11:10 one of the last episodes, you mentioned
11:11 

11:11 how AI is uh going to replace a lot of
11:14 

11:14 like the more functional bits of
11:17 

11:17 actually becoming a junior developer
11:20 

11:20 onwards. So we need to focus more on
11:22 

11:22 soft skills including working in teams.
11:23 

11:23 Like do you think like using MBTI as a
11:26 

11:26 guy? I know you have your own like
11:27 

11:27 opinions about it, right? Do you think
11:29 

11:29 using MTI as a guide to work with teams
11:31 

11:31 might be a good uh framework to guide uh
11:34 

11:34 future developers coming in who are
11:36 

11:36 afraid that you know now I need to
11:38 

11:38 develop more of my soft skills. No,
11:40 

11:40 definitely like uh before I met
11:42 

11:42 Victoria, I wasn't very aware of this
11:43 

11:43 kind of things. But after I met her,
11:45 

11:45 after I saw her explain it multiple
11:48 

11:48 times, what exactly how she uses it, I
11:51 

11:51 also saw the benefit of it. Like
11:53 

11:53 for me, the main benefit was I suddenly
11:56 

11:56 became a bit more forgiving cuz now I
11:58 

11:58 understand why certain people did
12:00 

12:00 certain things in a certain way. And
12:02 

12:02 then also uh I use it more like
12:05 

12:05 convincing like how would I convince
12:08 

12:08 this person to do something.
12:10 

12:10 They would naturally go towards for
12:12 

12:12 example show them some data like in the
12:13 

12:13 past this this these things happened and
12:15 

12:15 then this is how we can approach it and
12:17 

12:17 then to some people I would be like more
12:20 

12:20 you know the the customers would need to
12:22 

12:22 understand that this way those kind of
12:25 

12:25 things. So in that way I I I've been
12:27 

12:27 using it as well very subtly.
12:29 

12:29 Uh and definitely this is part of human
12:32 

12:32 interaction in teams and stuff.
12:34 

12:34 Not just in teams like not even at home
12:38 

12:38 with my family.
12:39 

12:39 I mean I'm not an expert like her but I
12:42 

12:42 can like tell subtle like very easy easy
12:46 

12:46 categories of how they're thinking right
12:49 

12:49 and it helps to some extent. If I read a
12:52 

12:52 bit deeper, I can actually use it to my
12:54 

12:54 benefit and feel like a manipulator, but
12:57 

12:57 a master puppeteer.
12:59 

12:59 But I mean, it does help to know where
13:01 

13:01 people are coming from, why are they
13:03 

13:03 saying certain things in a certain way,
13:04 

13:04 and how I can communicate with them in a
13:07 

13:07 more friendly manner
13:08 

13:08 that doesn't hurt anyone, things like
13:10 

13:10 that.
13:10 

13:10 Yeah. Yeah. No, actually like now that
13:12 

13:12 you put it that way, I guess MBTI,
13:14 

13:14 whether or not you subscribe to it fully
13:16 

13:16 or not, it's just a reminder that people
13:18 

13:18 work differently. People have different
13:20 

13:20 perspectives. The fact that just a
13:22 

13:22 simple framework like MBTI puts people
13:24 

13:24 already into 16 different categories.
13:27 

13:27 Like basically in a team, you have to
13:29 

13:29 consider that every single person works
13:31 

13:31 and thinks very differently. And I think
13:33 

13:33 what you said about like it allows you
13:34 

13:34 to be more forgiving to people. It
13:36 

13:36 allows you to like take a different
13:38 

13:38 perspective. I I think perhaps even if
13:40 

13:40 you don't believe in MBTI, that is the
13:42 

13:42 takeaway here. Yeah. That every time you
13:44 

13:44 come into uh work and you know you're
13:47 

13:47 delivering a certain suggestion and
13:48 

13:48 somebody comes back at you with a
13:50 

13:50 different one, it's not a personal
13:51 

13:51 attack.
13:52 

13:52 Oh, I have an example for this using
13:54 

13:54 Victoria as an example. For example, if
13:57 

13:57 I ever was to share like um something
14:01 

14:01 I'm feeling at work for with Victoria or
14:03 

14:03 some or any problem that I have in my
14:06 

14:06 life, uh she would I would I cannot
14:09 

14:09 expect her to validate what I'm feeling.
14:12 

14:12 She would give solutions.
14:13 

14:13 So I could have been offended by like
14:16 

14:16 why aren't you validating what I just
14:17 

14:17 said? Like why are you saying that? Yes,
14:19 

14:19 only that is a problem.
14:21 

14:21 Uh but then cuz now I know that's how
14:23 

14:23 she thinks. So then she comes with
14:25 

14:25 solutions. So whenever I ask her, get to
14:29 

14:29 her for advice now, I know she's going
14:32 

14:32 to give me solutions.
14:33 

14:33 So I only go to her if I want solutions,
14:36 

14:36 right? Not for feelings.
14:37 

14:37 I wouldn't go to her if I want to get am
14:40 

14:40 I am I correct to feel this way. I I
14:43 

14:43 wouldn't get my answer from her.
14:45 

14:45 So I I'll go to someone else. But
14:46 

14:46 it's not so much of that. I think like
14:48 

14:48 Victoria does try, right?
14:50 

14:50 I mean, so I know you are ISFJ, right?
14:54 

14:54 So I know that you need validation.
14:56 

14:56 I don't give validation for the sake of
14:59 

14:59 giving validation.
15:00 

15:00 So I only
15:01 

15:01 which I respect.
15:02 

15:02 I only agree if I do see that it is
15:06 

15:06 something I agree if I truly agree with
15:08 

15:08 it because
15:10 

15:10 sorry.
15:12 

15:12 Exactly. Which is which is fine because
15:14 

15:14 now I understand sometimes I actually
15:16 

15:16 want solutions
15:18 

15:18 and she's great at that. So, I know how
15:21 

15:21 to like go to people for what I need and
15:24 

15:24 I don't get offended or stuff any I
15:26 

15:26 don't think I was ever offended by
15:28 

15:28 Victoria, but
15:29 

15:29 someone else might be.
15:31 

15:31 I'm like, why are you validating me?
15:33 

15:33 But yeah, so that's one kind of example
15:36 

15:36 of understanding people and uh getting
15:39 

15:39 the right things,
15:41 

15:41 right?
15:42 

15:42 Give and take.
15:42 

15:42 I think that's the biggest thing for me,
15:44 

15:44 empathy, right? is because I think in a
15:46 

15:46 previous episode I mentioned I'm I'm not
15:49 

15:49 so much empathy. I'm more like a
15:50 

15:50 sympathetic person because I cannot
15:53 

15:53 directly feel like you know it's like
15:57 

15:57 it's your feelings not mine. How am I
15:59 

15:59 supposed to feel what you're feeling?
16:01 

16:01 Yeah, for sure. So I cannot directly
16:03 

16:03 empathize and maybe like in my very
16:07 

16:07 early adolescence years it frustrates me
16:10 

16:10 because I cannot understand people as
16:12 

16:12 deeply as you know my other friends
16:14 

16:14 would right but understanding how the
16:17 

16:17 person thinks and why they feeling this
16:20 

16:20 way it helps me at least have have this
16:23 

16:23 little empathy like at least
16:25 

16:25 it's like a mini empathy you know like I
16:27 

16:27 can understand them better like I
16:29 

16:29 understand oh why why salon is feeling
16:31 

16:31 like this
16:32 

16:32 right and like that.
16:33 

16:33 I think what you're basically saying is
16:35 

16:35 that like for some people like uh
16:37 

16:37 empathy doesn't come as intuitively like
16:40 

16:40 you mentioned but it's not an excuse to
16:42 

16:42 be unempathetic
16:44 

16:44 in general. There are ways uh for you to
16:46 

16:46 slowly learn the skills of empathy or to
16:48 

16:48 apply frameworks like in this case you
16:49 

16:49 use MBTI. You didn't make it an excuse.
16:51 

16:51 You you aren't like uh telling people
16:53 

16:53 like I'm sorry I'm objective. I just am
16:56 

16:56 not able to be empathetic. Instead, you
16:58 

16:58 actually went to research. You went to
17:00 

17:00 look at the ocean framework. You went to
17:01 

17:01 look at MBTI framework to really see how
17:04 

17:04 you can hone your skills of
17:05 

17:05 understanding how you can better work in
17:06 

17:06 a team. And I think that's the best
17:08 

17:08 takeaway that we can have from this
17:11 

17:11 conversation. We're not really asking
17:12 

17:12 you that you have to know your MBTI, you
17:15 

17:15 have to have the same expertise in being
17:17 

17:17 able to uh discern the MBTI of other
17:20 

17:20 people, but really especially uh even in
17:23 

17:23 the uh engineering field, especially if
17:26 

17:26 uh uh you know, we're kind of scared
17:28 

17:28 that AI is taking over more of the
17:30 

17:30 functional side of the house. Uh I we do
17:32 

17:32 see a trend that more of our work is
17:34 

17:34 going to be more people oriented. it's
17:36 

17:36 going to be more about team dynamics and
17:38 

17:38 with that it requires a lot of empathy
17:41 

17:41 and understanding how different people
17:42 

17:42 work. Um so you can use things like the
17:45 

17:45 MHI framework to you use it as a
17:48 

17:48 stepping stone to train yourself in uh
17:51 

17:51 learning how different people can work
17:53 

17:53 together and training yourself to be
17:55 

17:55 more empathetic so you can work better
17:56 

17:56 in the team.
17:57 

17:57 Yes. And also I like to point out that
17:59 

17:59 MBTI is also still a good way for
18:01 

18:01 building self-awareness
18:03 

18:03 because if you know exactly how you
18:04 

18:04 think you can overcome biases like for
18:08 

18:08 me I I know that sometimes I can be too
18:10 

18:10 logical
18:11 

18:11 and then I don't see I don't consider
18:13 

18:13 the person's feelings right
18:15 

18:15 then knowing that next time if like I'm
18:17 

18:17 considering many factors
18:20 

18:20 now I know that okay since last time I
18:22 

18:22 didn't consider people's feelings now I
18:24 

18:24 have to take this into account like I'll
18:26 

18:26 pay more attention
18:27 

18:27 to my pitfalls and my weaknesses. So
18:29 

18:29 being self-aware
18:30 

18:30 like you're you're growing.
18:32 

18:32 Yeah. Yeah. So again that's why as
18:35 

18:35 people grow I observe people also
18:37 

18:37 because of MTI also
18:39 

18:39 it gives me the habit of observing
18:41 

18:41 people cuz I need to understand them. So
18:43 

18:43 by observing people I see that
18:46 

18:46 people in like already like really have
18:48 

18:48 a lot of work experience right diverse
18:50 

18:50 work experience
18:52 

18:52 they're naturally become more balanced.
18:54 

18:54 they it becomes harder and harder to see
18:57 

18:57 them like their cognitive functions are
18:59 

18:59 all so developed that they don't super
19:02 

19:02 lean into a certain tendency. They
19:04 

19:04 already become quite balanced.
19:05 

19:05 Right. Right. Right.
19:06 

19:06 And that that should be the Yeah. That
19:07 

19:07 should be the aim, right? To be
19:09 

19:09 balanced.
19:10 

19:10 Yeah. So you have all of your cognitive
19:13 

19:13 functions really just
19:15 

19:15 uh driving and working together. Like
19:18 

19:18 for me, my weakness is FE
19:20 

19:20 cuz I'm FI, right? So I'm fe extroverted
19:23 

19:23 feeling means like the harmony of the
19:25 

19:25 team versus the goal of the project. I
19:28 

19:28 prioritize the goal first.
19:31 

19:31 I prioritize what I want first. Other
19:33 

19:33 people's opinions is like consider
19:35 

19:35 later, right?
19:37 

19:37 But if you see a typical like a textbook
19:40 

19:40 INTJ versus me, they will not guess I'm
19:44 

19:44 an INTJ at first
19:45 

19:45 because I no longer very as robotic as I
19:48 

19:48 was previously.
19:49 

19:49 You honed your skills. I try to I try to
19:52 

19:52 develop a little bit of that cognitive
19:55 

19:55 function.
19:56 

19:56 Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I like that
19:58 

19:58 you kind of like summed it up also that
19:60 

19:60 it's a lot about growth. You know, MBTI
20:02 

20:02 might tell you what your starting state
20:04 

20:04 uh tendencies are, but it also lets you
20:07 

20:07 be self-aware what you need to improve
20:09 

20:09 on to have the angle of being more
20:11 

20:11 balanced as a whole. Yeah. So regardless
20:13 

20:13 if you're in the engineering field or
20:15 

20:15 you're in other fields, uh I think like
20:17 

20:17 the uh uh the need to be empathetic
20:20 

20:20 towards others and the need to be
20:21 

20:21 self-aware still stands uh in order for
20:23 

20:23 you to grow in your career as a person.
20:26 

20:26 So yep, this was our take on uh MBTI uh
20:30 

20:30 how Victoria uses it in her day-to-day
20:33 

20:33 at work and how you know we can also
20:35 

20:35 like take advice from her and also use
20:37 

20:37 it as well. So, we hope this was helpful
20:39 

20:39 information for anyone who uh is looking
20:42 

20:42 for advice. How can I start off um you
20:45 

20:45 know uh being better at working in
20:46 

20:46 teams? Wait, I just like to add one more
20:48 

20:48 thing.
20:49 

20:49 Oh, yeah.
20:49 

20:49 Uh you can use this clip later.
20:51 

20:51 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
20:52 

20:52 There's this party trick I do at at
20:55 

20:55 meetups where I'll be like, "Hey,
20:57 

20:57 Victoria, meet Natasha."
20:59 

20:59 Oh,
20:59 

20:59 guess her. She can actually tell you
21:02 

21:02 your entire personality. That's that's
21:04 

21:04 Victoria's uh secret.
21:05 

21:05 Yeah. Yeah. I think we'll try it at a
21:06 

21:06 few hangers.
21:07 

21:07 I I do it at all the times whenever it
21:09 

21:09 gets open like she
21:10 

21:10 your party.
21:10 

21:10 I'm like uh guys, she can actually tell
21:13 

21:13 you who you are.
21:15 

21:15 Disclaimer, MBTI is not a party trick.
21:17 

21:17 And disclaimer, Salon Entertainment.
21:20 

21:20 Salon always introduce me like fun fact.
21:23 

21:23 This is my fun fact is my friend can
21:24 

21:24 guess MBTI. So I'm her fun fact and I'm
21:28 

21:28 her party trick.
21:29 

21:29 She's my entertainer. Well, I guess if
21:31 

21:31 you want to use MBTI as a party trick,
21:33 

21:33 either bring Victoria or learn MBTI.
21:35 

21:35 No, but disclaimer is like I need to
21:37 

21:37 observe.
21:37 

21:37 It's also fun and stuff.
21:39 

21:39 Yeah. It's just fun.
21:40 

21:40 I do give out that that disclaimer.
21:43 

21:43 Yes. Yes.
21:43 

21:43 And she needs to observe you for some
21:45 

21:45 time.
21:45 

21:45 Yeah. Like it's not like I immediately
21:47 

21:47 read your mind and like, oh, I know.
21:49 

21:49 But at the end, she can tell you who you
21:50 

21:50 are.
21:52 

21:52 Yeah. Leave your comments below. Um,
21:56 

21:56 wait. No, I don't think you can read
21:57 

21:57 anyone by pure comments alone. Okay,
21:59 

21:59 whatever. Tell us what you thought about
21:60 

22:00 this episode. And as always, remember to
22:02 

22:02 like, follow, and subscribe. Bye.
