00:01 Welcome to Rack Tech, the place for
00:03 

00:03 bites and banter. My name is Natasha.
00:05 

00:05 I'm a software engineer and co-host. And
00:07 

00:07 in this episode, we have Salony, also
00:09 

00:09 co-host and software engineer, as well
00:11 

00:11 as our guest speaker, Martin. Martin is
00:14 

00:14 a recently retired software engineer
00:16 

00:16 with experience being an educator in the
00:18 

00:18 tech community. I teach Python at the
00:20 

00:20 civil service and um I used to teach
00:23 

00:23 Python at General Assembly. Uh I just
00:26 

00:26 love teaching. In this episode, he's
00:28 

00:28 going to share with us his thoughts
00:30 

00:30 about how AI has changed learning,
00:32 

00:32 especially as he is considering
00:33 

00:33 homeschooling for his young daughter.
00:36 

00:36 [Music]
00:40 

00:40 I actually asked JGBT to teach me
00:42 

00:42 everything about statistics because, you
00:44 

00:44 know, I never was good at math. So, I
00:46 

00:46 wanted to see if it can teach me
00:48 

00:48 statistics and it could. And it could do
00:51 

00:51 it so well that I turned it into a
00:53 

00:53 statistics Python course for the Civil
00:55 

00:55 Service College. Oh. and and that is the
00:58 

00:58 best rated course of all courses in the
00:60 

00:60 civil service college. So if this thing
01:03 

01:03 could teach me something so well, it
01:05 

01:05 could teach anything to anyone. I
01:07 

01:07 believe especially things that you learn
01:09 

01:09 up until high school, I think can
01:12 

01:12 already do that very well. I actually uh
01:14 

01:14 use to teach me things like uh like
01:18 

01:18 concepts basically. Uh for example, in
01:21 

01:21 finances, you know, like there there are
01:23 

01:23 lots of these jarens that I use. I asked
01:25 

01:25 Chad GP to teach me in layman terms what
01:28 

01:28 this means and it does a very good job.
01:30 

01:30 Exactly. So and and you know first how
01:33 

01:33 do I know if I can trust chat? Right. So
01:36 

01:36 I asked it you can try this prompt. I'm
01:38 

01:38 a total beginner in Python. You are my
01:41 

01:41 mentor. Let's start. That's all you have
01:43 

01:43 to write. Oh yes. And you know I kept
01:45 

01:45 playing it the game with it. It keeps
01:48 

01:48 telling you about how to make variables
01:50 

01:50 and then uh it suggests a few exercises
01:53 

01:53 for you know like open visual studio
01:54 

01:54 write hello world print it and then I
01:56 

01:56 say okay I can see hello world then it
01:58 

01:58 teaches you about if and else first
02:01 

02:01 operators and then if and else and then
02:03 

02:03 for loops and then while loops and then
02:06 

02:06 um functions and then classes. It's
02:09 

02:09 exactly the same way how I teach Python
02:12 

02:12 as well. Yeah. And it even uses exactly
02:14 

02:14 the same sample codes that I used in my
02:16 

02:16 slides for many many years already as
02:19 

02:19 well. Right? So I could see yeah this
02:22 

02:22 thing teaches uh in the right order the
02:24 

02:24 right things in the right order. Right.
02:27 

02:27 So um if you prompt it correctly. If you
02:30 

02:30 prompt it correctly. Yeah. But but I
02:32 

02:32 mean that prompt was very minimalistic
02:33 

02:33 and it still worked out very well.
02:35 

02:35 Right. Um and um so and that's what what
02:40 

02:40 I mentioned to you earlier as well,
02:41 

02:41 right? Um this is the worst CHP will
02:44 

02:44 ever be or any other LLM. Claw is
02:47 

02:47 probably already better than CHP now. So
02:49 

02:49 like 3 years from now we will have an
02:52 

02:52 LLM that's significantly more
02:54 

02:54 intelligent than that. Significantly
02:56 

02:56 less hallucinations, better at citing
02:59 

02:59 its sources and so on so that you can
03:01 

03:01 double check and read go deeper into a
03:04 

03:04 topic. Um so I feel like every human on
03:07 

03:07 earth is soon going to have a personal
03:10 

03:10 mentor. So, we get that to that stage
03:12 

03:12 where we have mastery learning and
03:13 

03:13 one-on-one tutoring, right? I'm sure I
03:15 

03:15 mean rich people already do this. They
03:17 

03:17 send their students their their kids to
03:19 

03:19 private schools. They they get private
03:20 

03:20 tutors come to their places, right? And
03:23 

03:23 now we will democratize this. Everyone
03:25 

03:25 will have this education that all that
03:28 

03:28 so far has been reserved for rich people
03:30 

03:30 only, right? And then um it becomes a
03:32 

03:32 game theory kind of thing. the first
03:34 

03:34 country that um you know uh overhauls
03:37 

03:37 the education system and just uses AI to
03:40 

03:40 have one-on-one mastery learning for
03:42 

03:42 every single child in the country will
03:44 

03:44 produce an explosion of intelligence and
03:47 

03:47 capabilities in that country that um
03:49 

03:49 other countries will notice and I think
03:51 

03:51 then this will just spread through the
03:53 

03:53 throughout the entire globe very quickly
03:55 

03:55 and I think schools will become places
03:58 

03:58 of social gathering only where the
04:00 

04:00 students uh uh they will use the AI eyes
04:04 

04:04 to learn and maybe it usually um results
04:07 

04:07 in a project that the student will do
04:09 

04:09 and they will all gather at the school
04:10 

04:10 to present the projects to each other
04:12 

04:12 right so that's how I could imagine the
04:15 

04:15 future of education could look like and
04:17 

04:17 I can imagine that a company
04:19 

04:19 I always say company but I mean country
04:22 

04:22 but Singapore is run like a company
04:24 

04:24 right
04:25 

04:25 truly on slip but it's also true um so a
04:29 

04:29 country like Singapore has been always
04:30 

04:30 very good at embracing new technologies
04:32 

04:32 very very quickly So I can see that
04:35 

04:35 actually in Singapore we could end up
04:36 

04:36 with something like this, right? And I
04:38 

04:38 mean homeschooling is allowed unlike
04:40 

04:40 many other countries in the world.
04:42 

04:42 Germany is not allowed. Oh, not allowed.
04:44 

04:44 Not allowed. Switzerland. I think public
04:46 

04:46 education is free. Yeah, it's free but I
04:48 

04:48 mean it's still public education. Let's
04:51 

04:51 be honest, public education is partly
04:53 

04:53 indoctrination, right? Um I can see that
04:57 

04:57 a country doesn't want to get let go of
04:58 

04:58 that, right? So u I know that as as a as
05:02 

05:02 a homeschooler I will have to provide
05:04 

05:04 lots of paperwork to to show to the
05:08 

05:08 ministry of education how I'm going to
05:10 

05:10 do this. So it's legal in it's legal but
05:13 

05:13 you have to have a a degree uh a
05:16 

05:16 master's degree and you have to you as
05:19 

05:19 in the teacher me
05:23 

05:23 um and you have to get a license to be a
05:25 

05:25 teacher which cost like $1,200 a year or
05:28 

05:28 something like that. Uh I haven't gone
05:30 

05:30 too deeply into all of this just you
05:31 

05:31 know brows around a little bit already.
05:33 

05:33 I mean I still have a few years before
05:35 

05:35 this really becomes relevant. Um but
05:37 

05:37 yeah and then you have to write down
05:38 

05:38 exactly how you are going to teach with
05:40 

05:40 which materials every single topic and
05:43 

05:43 things like um you know it's it's not
05:45 

05:45 just how are you going to teach reading
05:47 

05:47 writing math I mean that's really simp
05:49 

05:49 simple it's not difficult anyone can do
05:51 

05:51 that but also things like uh
05:54 

05:54 understanding the history of the country
05:55 

05:55 and you know creating a patriotic child
05:58 

05:58 you have to prove that as well oh like
05:59 

05:59 social studies that yeah so I will have
06:03 

06:03 to teach my child the the national
06:05 

06:05 anthem of Singapore. So I have to learn
06:07 

06:07 it myself now.
06:11 

06:11 That's going to be interesting. So it's
06:12 

06:12 going to be a learning uh journey for
06:14 

06:14 you as well. Totally. For me, you have
06:15 

06:15 to learn first before extremely looking
06:17 

06:17 forward to this actually teaching myself
06:20 

06:20 all these basic concepts from scratch
06:22 

06:22 again. I'm super looking forward to that
06:24 

06:24 because like I said, I suck at math and
06:26 

06:26 I will now become good at math alongside
06:29 

06:29 my daughter, right? I'm teaching her
06:31 

06:31 with the help of GPT6 whatever we will
06:33 

06:33 have 6 years from now. Right. Right.
06:35 

06:35 Right. Right.
06:37 

06:37 And I always say this like teaching is
06:39 

06:39 the best way to learn. Exact. Yeah.
06:41 

06:41 Yeah. For sure. For sure. I totally
06:44 

06:44 agree with that. Yeah. Um another reason
06:46 

06:46 why I, you know, do these meetups and
06:49 

06:49 give talks. If you have to prepare your
06:51 

06:51 stuff to give a tech talk, that is the
06:54 

06:54 only way you're really truly going to
06:56 

06:56 understand it, right? because you don't
06:58 

06:58 want to you don't want to talk nonsense
06:60 

06:60 in front of an audience where somebody
07:01 

07:01 might ask a tricky question afterwards,
07:03 

07:03 right? So, you want to come prepared.
07:05 

07:05 That that's the philosophy of my life.
07:07 

07:07 Yeah. If I ever want to like learn
07:09 

07:09 something, I'll give I'll put myself up
07:11 

07:11 for giving a talk on it or something
07:13 

07:13 like that. That's really the best way.
07:15 

07:15 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everybody ask me,
07:17 

07:17 "Oh, but what about the socializing
07:19 

07:19 aspect when you do homeschooling?"
07:21 

07:21 That's the first question every single
07:23 

07:23 person that I pitch this idea to bounces
07:26 

07:26 back to me like, "Well, what about the
07:27 

07:27 socializing?" Um, yeah, it's actually a
07:30 

07:30 very good question. It's going to be
07:31 

07:31 difficult obviously, but I feel like
07:34 

07:34 there are sports clubs, music clubs,
07:38 

07:38 whatever, right? Uh, there there are
07:41 

07:41 playgrounds at every single block
07:42 

07:42 everywhere in Singapore. I just
07:43 

07:43 literally have to go down to the
07:44 

07:44 playground and there are like 20 new
07:46 

07:46 friends that my daughter can make
07:47 

07:47 immediately right from the from the from
07:50 

07:50 our direct neighbors. Um I feel like the
07:53 

07:53 socializing is not going to be an issue.
07:55 

07:55 Um and I feel like a lot of socializing
07:57 

07:57 in school is actually uh bullying.
08:00 

08:00 Children can be quite brutal, right? Um
08:03 

08:03 so lots of uh socializing in school also
08:07 

08:07 in my own experience from from my school
08:09 

08:09 time is bullying simply and I don't I
08:12 

08:12 don't think it's valuable for for
08:14 

08:14 somebody to pick that up. Um and then
08:17 

08:17 once you get into the workforce I mean
08:19 

08:19 there's also bullying there's office
08:20 

08:20 politics and all that but I mean there
08:22 

08:22 you have me you can go to HR and
08:23 

08:23 complain and it's not it's not as tough
08:27 

08:27 as in an actual school setting where
08:29 

08:29 children are just murdering each other.
08:33 

08:33 can be really brutal in Asian society.
08:35 

08:35 That might that might be as well.
08:37 

08:37 Especially if they're a little
08:38 

08:38 different. Yes. From
08:41 

08:41 Yeah, I can attest to that. We're a
08:43 

08:43 little bit different in a you know,
08:46 

08:46 fairly homogeneous society. And even
08:47 

08:47 though we're diverse in terms of uh
08:49 

08:49 racial uh ethnicity wise, I think the
08:53 

08:53 the our values and cultures tend to be
08:55 

08:55 very homogeneous. And if you stand out,
08:56 

08:56 if you start becoming that person that
08:58 

08:58 speaks up more, who thinks differently,
09:00 

09:00 which ironically are skills that our
09:02 

09:02 society is trying to like embed into our
09:05 

09:05 curriculum, you get discriminated a lot
09:07 

09:07 and bullied. So maybe with that
09:09 

09:09 perspective it, you know, homeschooling
09:12 

09:12 could like bode well to uh having your
09:14 

09:14 child have like their own unique
09:16 

09:16 personality and traits without being
09:17 

09:17 discriminated against so that they could
09:19 

09:19 excel in the workplace because these, as
09:22 

09:22 you can see, even in like engineering
09:24 

09:24 with chat GPT coming along the way,
09:26 

09:26 we're not, you know, people are not
09:28 

09:28 going to value us just for being like
09:30 

09:30 code monkeys anymore. We're going to
09:32 

09:32 need those skills to start innovating to
09:35 

09:35 start like you know what does it take to
09:37 

09:37 work in a team to summarize ideas from
09:39 

09:39 like different people and these are
09:41 

09:41 higher level skills um that AI can
09:43 

09:43 already like solve those lower level
09:45 

09:45 skills. True. And actually when you
09:47 

09:47 mention it, when you look at it that
09:48 

09:48 way, I feel there's a huge disruption
09:50 

09:50 coming towards Singapore because this
09:53 

09:53 kind of intelligence that Singapore
09:55 

09:55 school system puts into the heads of the
09:57 

09:57 children is going to be become
09:59 

09:59 worthless. Right. The cost for this kind
10:01 

10:01 of intelligence trends towards zero now
10:03 

10:03 is being done by machines. What we now
10:05 

10:05 need is creativity. Yes. Exactly. And
10:08 

10:08 our schools haven't hacked that part,
10:10 

10:10 the creative part. Um, and how how do
10:12 

10:12 you think you're going to hack it in
10:13 

10:13 your homeschooling system? Have you
10:15 

10:15 figured that out yet? I mean, I have my
10:17 

10:17 my visions already, right? I see myself
10:19 

10:19 already. Okay, how how am I going to do
10:21 

10:21 this in four years when when she gets to
10:23 

10:23 the point where, you know, childhood is
10:25 

10:25 over and now now the teaching begins. Um
10:30 

10:30 yeah, but I think this mastery learning
10:33 

10:33 aspect is is a big part of it, right?
10:35 

10:35 So, uh we will start every topic very
10:38 

10:38 dry, but um
10:42 

10:42 actually not very dry. So every topic
10:44 

10:44 needs to be tied to some real world
10:46 

10:46 applications.
10:48 

10:48 So um I think um I will spend not so
10:52 

10:52 much time with her sitting at a desk and
10:56 

10:56 crunching numbers or whatever but more
10:58 

10:58 like doing excursions going out looking
11:00 

11:00 at things in the real world museums
11:03 

11:03 whatever and um always trying to find
11:06 

11:06 what can we do what can we build in
11:08 

11:08 order to uh make this uh idea stick.
11:11 

11:11 Yes. Yes. It's very Montasurari based
11:13 

11:13 kind of like approach and honestly I
11:15 

11:15 feel like it might have come from your
11:17 

11:17 uh you knowing that you can learn
11:19 

11:19 anything because you learn Python on
11:21 

11:21 your own you learn how to like build uh
11:23 

11:23 things on your own and I think mastery
11:25 

11:25 of any subject it's about having those
11:27 

11:27 building blocks we always start there
11:29 

11:29 but if you already come in with that
11:30 

11:30 intention that I want to create I mean
11:32 

11:32 hence the word creativity right it comes
11:34 

11:34 from uh knowing that you have the
11:36 

11:36 resources to create and you're endowing
11:38 

11:38 your child with that mastery so they
11:40 

11:40 have that building blockm also endowing
11:42 

11:42 them with the knowledge that you're
11:43 

11:43 going to use these to create whatever
11:45 

11:45 you want later. I think that's a
11:46 

11:46 valuable part and the thing about
11:48 

11:48 standardized education is that it
11:51 

11:51 doesn't do that latter part. It gives
11:52 

11:52 you that mastery but it doesn't give you
11:55 

11:55 the autonomy to create you know it's
11:57 

11:57 telling you that the end result there is
11:59 

11:59 only one end result that test that
12:02 

12:02 whatever that's why role memorization
12:04 

12:04 becomes the most efficient yes way to
12:07 

12:07 achieve that but what if the deliverable
12:09 

12:09 and outcome wasn't that one deliverable
12:12 

12:12 and it had had many many many different
12:14 

12:14 outcomes then if you think about it from
12:15 

12:15 an efficiency perspective what are like
12:18 

12:18 the base level skills you need that
12:19 

12:19 inherent creativity another reason um
12:23 

12:23 why I think I can do it is I mean many
12:26 

12:26 people might think this is like super
12:28 

12:28 timeconuming I it probably is I wouldn't
12:31 

12:31 do this as a believe naively believing I
12:34 

12:34 can do this while I'm still working that
12:36 

12:36 would be too risky right um but when I
12:39 

12:39 think about my time in school especially
12:41 

12:41 the earlier years of primary school
12:43 

12:43 secondary school and even high school
12:46 

12:46 there's so much boiler plate where you
12:48 

12:48 don't do learning like the first five
12:50 

12:50 minutes the teacher tries to get the
12:52 

12:52 class be quiet. The next five minutes,
12:53 

12:53 the teacher tries to get to look at the
12:55 

12:55 homeworks, right? Then make sure that
12:57 

12:57 everybody understood their homeworks and
12:59 

12:59 scold the people who didn't do the
12:60 

12:60 homeworks. The next five minutes teacher
13:01 

13:01 is trying to get everyone to open the
13:03 

13:03 book at the right page for the next
13:04 

13:04 topic, right? Then there might be 5 to
13:07 

13:07 10 minutes of actual learning. So, and
13:11 

13:11 then there's 5 minutes of explaining the
13:12 

13:12 next homework and packing up and then
13:14 

13:14 it's over. 45 minutes gone. So 10
13:17 

13:17 minutes and you do usually six uh six
13:20 

13:20 lessons per day at least in Germany. I
13:22 

13:22 don't know how long school is here. So
13:24 

13:24 that's 16 minutes of actual learning in
13:27 

13:27 a day, right? And I will get rid of all
13:30 

13:30 this boiler plate. There will be no
13:31 

13:31 noisy children, right? No no child
13:34 

13:34 that's throwing paper balls in the
13:36 

13:36 classroom. This was normal in I don't
13:38 

13:38 know how I think the the classrooms in
13:40 

13:40 Singapore are probably more orderly,
13:42 

13:42 right? It is. I think it's more orderly.
13:45 

13:45 depends on the school. The ball throwing
13:46 

13:46 so happens. Yeah. But so so far what I
13:49 

13:49 have read um from looking at YouTube
13:51 

13:51 videos of homeschoolers around the
13:52 

13:52 world, they all say they do the actual
13:54 

13:54 schooling in two to three hours in the
13:56 

13:56 morning and the rest of the day is
13:58 

13:58 excursions and you know experiencing the
14:00 

14:00 real world. And I find that quite
14:03 

14:03 believable. I I think I can get it done
14:05 

14:05 in that time as well. Especially when I
14:07 

14:07 think about how I teach complex topics
14:10 

14:10 already to adults. I mean I teach to
14:12 

14:12 adults. So that's going to be a tricky
14:14 

14:14 thing where I need to be careful.
14:16 

14:16 Teaching children is very different from
14:18 

14:18 teaching adults. Of course, I'm aware of
14:19 

14:19 that. Need to be much more patient and
14:21 

14:21 so on. Um but yeah, so so that's the
14:25 

14:25 other thing that um I have in my mind.
14:28 

14:28 You can condense 10 years of school into
14:32 

14:32 one sixth of that time and get through
14:35 

14:35 all that. You can get through that much
14:36 

14:36 much faster, right? And then I hope that
14:39 

14:39 I I foresee that I will have a full
14:43 

14:43 functioning member of society by the
14:44 

14:44 time she's probably 12 or whatever. And
14:46 

14:46 then I want her to go out and uh find
14:49 

14:49 her passion basically, right? Education
14:51 

14:51 is done. Go around and find your
14:53 

14:53 passion. See what whatever uh keeps her
14:57 

14:57 entertained for like days and days and
14:59 

14:59 days, right? And then as she finds her
15:02 

15:02 passion, she will become very very good
15:04 

15:04 at that thing, right? Everyone says if
15:06 

15:06 you want to stand out, find that one
15:08 

15:08 thing that no one else in the world does
15:10 

15:10 and you become very good. You become the
15:12 

15:12 best in the world at that one thing and
15:14 

15:14 your life is going to be fine, right?
15:16 

15:16 And that's this is what I'm hoping to
15:18 

15:18 enable for my daughter eventually as
15:19 

15:19 well. Like she will just bounce around
15:21 

15:21 and try out this and that and this. I
15:22 

15:22 will just enable everything. My parents
15:24 

15:24 did that for me actually as well. Now
15:25 

15:25 when I think back to it, if I showed any
15:28 

15:28 interested in swimming, they put me into
15:30 

15:30 a swimming class. you know, they put me
15:32 

15:32 into a chess club. When I touched one
15:34 

15:34 chessboard, as I pushed a key on the
15:37 

15:37 piano, they bought me a a keyboard. And
15:41 

15:41 um and I just selftaught myself,
15:42 

15:42 whatever. I just had some time, right?
15:44 

15:44 And um so yeah, humans are knowledge
15:50 

15:50 sponges and and and self-learning
15:52 

15:52 machines, right? And um I just want to
15:55 

15:55 enable that basically. And I think the
15:58 

15:58 outcome will will be good in the end. It
15:60 

15:60 worked for me.
16:01 

16:01 It's going to work for her as well, I'm
16:02 

16:02 sure. Yeah. And good is subjective.
16:05 

16:05 Anyways, I think the one of the most
16:07 

16:07 important things you're going to get out
16:08 

16:08 of this is that bond that you'll share
16:09 

16:09 with your daughter. That's incredible
16:12 

16:12 privilege. Yes. Yes. Because a lot of
16:14 

16:14 like children don't have this with their
16:16 

16:16 parents, especially when we were talking
16:18 

16:18 about the tendency for dual working
16:20 

16:20 parents, you know, and you're basically
16:22 

16:22 outsourcing that bond, that care, that
16:24 

16:24 education, right? Maybe. Yeah. Now that
16:27 

16:27 you touched on that topic, brings us
16:29 

16:29 back to the very beginning when you ask
16:31 

16:31 like what's your day like with your with
16:32 

16:32 your newborn now. Um, so you know, I
16:36 

16:36 mentioned I was very late as a parent,
16:37 

16:37 right? So all my friends already have
16:39 

16:39 two children and they all like 10 years
16:41 

16:41 old already, right? Um, so and so I I
16:44 

16:44 saw all these babies coming into the
16:46 

16:46 world and of course I love them all and
16:48 

16:48 usually my friends kids also like me
16:51 

16:51 very much whenever I come to visit in
16:53 

16:53 Christmas during Christmas time. Yeah.
16:54 

16:54 the the cool uncle who brings the cool
16:56 

16:56 toys, right? Um but then they are all
16:59 

16:59 very cute, but then when they scream,
17:01 

17:01 you're like, "Oh my god, this is so
17:03 

17:03 annoying." Right? And I can see how lots
17:05 

17:05 of young people they feel like I don't
17:07 

17:07 want to be a parent. Like I want to
17:08 

17:08 enjoy my life, you know, want to travel
17:10 

17:10 the world. But when you get my when I
17:12 

17:12 got my own child, the screaming is
17:15 

17:15 different. It's it's not the kind of
17:17 

17:17 screaming that you hear from other
17:18 

17:18 children when you go to the mall or
17:20 

17:20 whatever. The screams of your own child
17:22 

17:22 is a language that you immediately
17:24 

17:24 understand. Like after three days, we
17:26 

17:26 could distinguish the I'm hungry scream
17:28 

17:28 from the my diaper is full scream from
17:30 

17:30 the I have colleagues scream. There's a
17:32 

17:32 three different distinct screams. So you
17:34 

17:34 don't you don't feel stressed anymore
17:37 

17:37 about this noise because it's actual
17:39 

17:39 communication going on and you're like
17:41 

17:41 damn she's like only 2 months old by by
17:44 

17:44 mimicking by by what she does with her
17:46 

17:46 eyes and eyebrows and smiles. when she
17:49 

17:49 starts smiling, it's the best ever. Uh,
17:50 

17:50 and when she starts laughing, it's even
17:52 

17:52 better. Um, and so with your own child,
17:56 

17:56 so like if there are people out there
17:57 

17:57 who who feel like, I don't want to have
17:59 

17:59 that, it's like too difficult. It's too
18:01 

18:01 too noisy and too crazy. No, it's
18:02 

18:02 actually not. If it's your own baby, you
18:06 

18:06 don't realize this as screaming, as
18:08 

18:08 noise. You It's It's actual
18:11 

18:11 communication going on right from the
18:12 

18:12 beginning, from day one. Yeah, that's
18:15 

18:15 very true. It's quite remarkable. Yeah.
18:17 

18:17 Yeah. I I really love your entire
18:20 

18:20 perspective on parenting. There's so
18:22 

18:22 much awe and there's so much learning,
18:24 

18:24 you know, even though we're talking
18:26 

18:26 about homeschooling education for the
18:28 

18:28 child, we're talking a lot about how I'm
18:30 

18:30 excited to learn to teach my child. And
18:33 

18:33 really, it just reminds me of this whole
18:36 

18:36 my my own joy at being an engineer also.
18:39 

18:39 It's it's very similar just it's a new
18:41 

18:41 problem to solve like uh you know, you
18:43 

18:43 were talking about just now. It's it's a
18:45 

18:45 new thing to learn. I feel like as
18:47 

18:47 engineers, we are probably better
18:49 

18:49 parents. I feel like I'm constantly
18:51 

18:51 debugging my own baby, right? I I
18:55 

18:55 literally have flowcharts in my mind.
18:56 

18:56 Oh, she screams. Okay, did she pee? No,
18:58 

18:58 diaper is fine. Does it Does it look
19:01 

19:01 like she's in pain? Okay, let's do a
19:02 

19:02 little bit of a baby massage. Okay,
19:04 

19:04 she's still screaming. Oh, maybe she's
19:05 

19:05 bored. Let's go to a different room. The
19:07 

19:07 screaming stops, right? So, like I have
19:08 

19:08 this flowchart already how to debug my
19:12 

19:12 baby. debugging and you're never once
19:13 

19:13 frustrated because you're like, "Okay, I
19:15 

19:15 just have to find another alternative. I
19:17 

19:17 just have to find something else. There
19:18 

19:18 must always be like a root problem that
19:20 

19:20 I can solve." Yeah. Exactly. So, I think
19:23 

19:23 we're trained to be very patient, very
19:25 

19:25 resourceful. Um, very logical. Yeah.
19:28 

19:28 Exactly. Very logical, too. And where we
19:31 

19:31 don't know, we just find resources from
19:33 

19:33 elsewhere. You know, we read other
19:34 

19:34 books, we look at online resources, we
19:36 

19:36 look at what other parents are doing, we
19:38 

19:38 ask other gurus in the community. It's
19:41 

19:41 actually the same similar approach,
19:43 

19:43 right? Which is another good point that
19:46 

19:46 you bring up that I forgot when we were
19:48 

19:48 talking about homeschooling. Um, we live
19:51 

19:51 in a point in time now where virtually
19:54 

19:54 all human knowledge is available to
19:56 

19:56 everyone. We have tutorials about
19:58 

19:58 everything on YouTube. We have Corsera,
19:60 

19:60 Udemy, Khan Academy. We have um that
20:03 

20:03 website um lip lip gen where all books I
20:07 

20:07 mean it's pirated. Don't use it. Don't
20:09 

20:09 use it. um we're not using it. There's a
20:11 

20:11 command line tool where you can just
20:13 

20:13 download any book very easily.
20:17 

20:17 Um and then there's this other lady from
20:19 

20:19 uh is it Pakistan or or some place uh
20:23 

20:23 where she has all the journal papers,
20:27 

20:27 all pirated journal papers, right? And
20:29 

20:29 we have archive. Um, so it's an
20:32 

20:32 incredible point in time right now where
20:35 

20:35 this wouldn't have been possible for us
20:37 

20:37 growing up where there was no internet.
20:39 

20:39 Right now we have it and it's all there.
20:41 

20:41 Of course, it gets more and more
20:42 

20:42 monetized now. So download as much as
20:45 

20:45 you can while it's still free, I would
20:46 

20:46 say. I have a few terabytes at home. I'm
20:48 

20:48 just downloading all the stuff all the
20:50 

20:50 time. Um, so yeah, that that needs to be
20:54 

20:54 said, right? Um, we live in this world
20:56 

20:56 now where all this knowledge is there
20:58 

20:58 and LLMs will actually empower us to
21:00 

21:00 sift through that knowledge in a in a in
21:03 

21:03 a more structured way. I mean, that's
21:07 

21:07 it's also two coins, right? There's all
21:08 

21:08 this knowledge, but there's a lot of
21:09 

21:09 noise and very little signal, right?
21:12 

21:12 There are so many scientific papers that
21:13 

21:13 are fraudulent or not not reproducible
21:15 

21:15 and whatever uh or like biased um thanks
21:19 

21:19 to financial incentives behind them that
21:21 

21:21 are not uh communicated and so on. Um,
21:24 

21:24 and I feel like with LLMs, we will be
21:27 

21:27 able to just soak all soak in all that
21:30 

21:30 knowledge, vectorize it, and then ask
21:32 

21:32 the LLM what if if there are certain big
21:35 

21:35 picture patterns that it can see. Um, so
21:39 

21:39 it's it's going to be great. So, I've
21:41 

21:41 been doing this actually for a while. I
21:42 

21:42 mentioned this earlier, right? Um,
21:44 

21:44 before the talk that I built a little
21:46 

21:46 tool to summarize YouTube videos. Yeah.
21:49 

21:49 Um, and I gave talks about this at the
21:51 

21:51 library on how I built it. So u it's
21:53 

21:53 open source. Anyone can actually now
21:54 

21:54 download it. It's a docker container
21:56 

21:56 docker up and the tool runs for you. Um
21:59 

21:59 and it's incredible. I I have been
22:01 

22:01 piping all interesting YouTube videos,
22:04 

22:04 two three-hour long videos, podcasts
22:06 

22:06 usually, right? Which I would never have
22:07 

22:07 had the time to watch and and now I just
22:10 

22:10 pipe it into the tool like 30 seconds
22:12 

22:12 later I have I have a bullet point
22:14 

22:14 summary and it's a very very accurate
22:16 

22:16 summary. Like JBT is really good at
22:19 

22:19 taking some text and summarizing. There
22:20 

22:20 is no room for hallucination because it
22:22 

22:22 just takes the content that's already in
22:24 

22:24 the context. That's true. And these
22:26 

22:26 summaries are just incredible. Like I
22:28 

22:28 can soak up so much knowledge in very
22:30 

22:30 very short amount of time and I'm saving
22:33 

22:33 all these summaries into my notes app.
22:35 

22:35 And then I vectorize all these summaries
22:38 

22:38 and now I can speak to my own notes. So
22:41 

22:41 I've been taking notes my whole life,
22:43 

22:43 but it's usually like a black hole.
22:44 

22:44 Everything goes into my notes app and
22:46 

22:46 never I never look at it again, right?
22:48 

22:48 And now I actually can I can literally
22:50 

22:50 ask what do I know? I'm very into keto
22:53 

22:53 diet and and you know nutrition and so
22:55 

22:55 on. What do I know about correlation
22:57 

22:57 between high cholesterol and heart
22:58 

22:58 disease for for example? And it's going
23:00 

23:00 to tell me based on my notes what uh
23:04 

23:04 what my current knowledge is about this
23:06 

23:06 topic, right? And imagine if we could
23:09 

23:09 just scrape every single scientific
23:11 

23:11 paper like that and then ask questions
23:13 

23:13 about that. like you know maybe you want
23:15 

23:15 to dive deep into a certain topic maybe
23:17 

23:17 blockchain you you you collect all
23:19 

23:19 scientific papers about blockchains and
23:21 

23:21 then you just pipe them all into an LLM
23:22 

23:22 and then you start using this mentor
23:25 

23:25 that you build for yourself to teach you
23:26 

23:26 about that topic and then you you know
23:28 

23:28 it's yeah it's it's more interactive to
23:34 

23:34 speak to that knowledge than reading all
23:36 

23:36 those papers and finding the little bits
23:38 

23:38 of nuggets of true wisdom in a huge
23:41 

23:41 amount of text. Right. Right. Right.
23:43 

23:43 Yeah. especially in this day and age of
23:45 

23:45 just information overload, right? Yeah.
23:47 

23:47 I I like how you summarize all of that
23:49 

23:49 that in this day and age, learning takes
23:52 

23:52 on a different tone. Um even though our
23:55 

23:55 standardized education systems might not
23:57 

23:57 have like evolved to uh change for this
23:60 

23:60 generation, we do have like the
24:02 

24:02 resources and that autonomy to use these
24:04 

24:04 AI tools to use these LLM to learn for
24:07 

24:07 ourselves and not just learn for
24:08 

24:08 ourselves to teach it to the next
24:09 

24:09 generation as well like in your case.
24:11 

24:11 And I feel like with all that we've
24:13 

24:13 talked about, you know, we've talked
24:14 

24:14 about like uh open source, the Python
24:16 

24:16 community, we've talked about um uh uh
24:20 

24:20 finances and then now we're talking
24:22 

24:22 about learning. Actually, this entire
24:24 

24:24 journey as an engineer, I think learning
24:26 

24:26 is like such a um prevalent theme that
24:29 

24:29 keeps coming about, you know, with like
24:30 

24:30 open source community, Python, it's
24:32 

24:32 about learning from community. It's
24:33 

24:33 about sharing that knowledge. Finances,
24:35 

24:35 it's also about like doing your due
24:37 

24:37 diligence, learning what works for you
24:39 

24:39 and what doesn't. And then obviously
24:41 

24:41 when we're talking about like being a
24:42 

24:42 dad, being uh like like exploring
24:44 

24:44 homeschooling, knowing what works for
24:46 

24:46 your kid and what doesn't, that's also
24:47 

24:47 learning as well. And being an engineer
24:50 

24:50 might prime you to be a better parent as
24:52 

24:52 well. So I think we've learned a lot
24:54 

24:54 from you, Martin, from your very diverse
24:58 

24:58 um experiences. And uh I'm sure this
25:01 

25:01 will not be the first time that we're
25:02 

25:02 going to talk to you. you said you were
25:04 

25:04 also exploring some sort of like podcast
25:06 

25:06 channel as well or or maybe like a means
25:09 

25:09 to share knowledge more. So, we'll be
25:11 

25:11 happy to see how we can work with you on
25:12 

25:12 this journey as well. But thank you so
25:14
