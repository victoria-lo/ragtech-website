00:00 I'm going to pretend to do system design
00:02 

00:02 live in front of everybody.
00:04 

00:04 >> Suddenly slapping a system design
00:05 

00:05 interview for you. I would go for
00:08 

00:08 maybe I don't have the luxury to pick,
00:11 

00:11 you know.
00:12 

00:13 [Music]
00:18 

00:18 Hello everybody and welcome to Recag.
00:20 

00:20 This is the place where we talk about
00:21 

00:21 real life in tech and today we are
00:23 

00:23 starting on a very special new series.
00:25 

00:25 This series is AI is not taking my job
00:28 

00:28 insert role and we will basically be
00:30 

00:30 exploring different roles in tech as
00:32 

00:32 well as exploring why AI wouldn't be
00:34 

00:34 taking their jobs. So uh first we'll
00:36 

00:36 introduce ourselves. I'm Natasha. I'm a
00:38 

00:38 software engineer. I'm Victoria
00:40 

00:40 solutions engineer. Salon software
00:42 

00:42 developer. And today our guest is
00:44 

00:44 actually also our co-host Salon. So uh
00:47 

00:47 Salon is actually a software engineer.
00:50 

00:50 She's more than just a software
00:51 

00:51 engineer. She's also our co-director at
00:53 

00:53 Women Devs.
00:54 

00:54 >> Yes. and she's passionate about learning
00:56 

00:56 about you know giving back to the
00:58 

00:58 community as well as you know mentoring
00:60 

00:60 other software developers. She's also
01:02 

01:02 really super passionate about anything
01:04 

01:04 related to system design you know design
01:06 

01:06 patterns and all that. So and recently
01:09 

01:09 she's also been doing a lot of workshops
01:11 

01:11 on uh AI and how she feels about it uh
01:14 

01:14 as a software engineer. Uh but you know
01:16 

01:16 we don't want to take the spotlight away
01:18 

01:18 from Salon. So uh Salony you can
01:20 

01:20 introduce yourself this time uh
01:22 

01:22 highlighting more about your role as a
01:24 

01:24 software engineer.
01:25 

01:25 >> Hello everyone. So as a software
01:28 

01:28 engineer either we will be creating apps
01:30 

01:30 from scratch. So imagine creating an
01:33 

01:33 whole new app whole new WhatsApp app by
01:36 

01:36 itself or I would be fixing bugs on
01:39 

01:39 existing apps. So for example, if
01:41 

01:41 there's something you're not able to
01:42 

01:42 upload images onto WhatsApp uh and
01:45 

01:45 there's something wrong is a software
01:47 

01:47 developers who go in and fix it takes a
01:49 

01:49 couple of days to fix such things or we
01:51 

01:51 could be adding a new feature onto
01:53 

01:53 existing apps. So these are the kind of
01:55 

01:55 things we're usually working on but
01:57 

01:57 besides that we also have to collaborate
01:60 

02:00 with hum other teammates discuss system
02:03 

02:03 design uh how exactly we'll design
02:05 

02:05 certain bug fixes or certain features
02:08 

02:08 and should we or should we not even
02:10 

02:10 prioritize these features in the first
02:12 

02:12 place with our customers even like it
02:14 

02:14 get the numbers up uh you know run SQL
02:17 

02:17 queries to get all these analysis and
02:19 

02:19 stuff so in a nutshell that's what
02:21 

02:21 software developers be
02:24 

02:24 I know that was quite a technical
02:25 

02:25 explanation, but a great explanation
02:27 

02:27 nonetheless. But we're actually going to
02:29 

02:29 do something quite interesting today.
02:31 

02:31 So, you can see right here we have a few
02:33 

02:33 cards um system design cards and um this
02:37 

02:37 deck uh are actually works. So, just now
02:39 

02:39 you mentioned that you work with
02:42 

02:42 different members in the team. you know
02:44 

02:44 uh you're more than just working just
02:46 

02:46 with software engineers and even in the
02:47 

02:47 software engineering field um we also
02:49 

02:49 tend to divide ourselves into uh
02:52 

02:52 different uh sub uh expertise. Uh so you
02:55 

02:55 can take a look at these cards and see
02:57 

02:57 which ones uh you know you feel best
02:60 

02:60 describe your role uh as a software
03:02 

03:02 engineer. Also you can pick out a few uh
03:04 

03:04 if you want to talk about who you work
03:05 

03:05 with in a team.
03:06 

03:06 >> Interesting. I definitely see software
03:10 

03:10 engineer as my own role. Uh we do
03:14 

03:14 collaborate a lot with product managers.
03:18 

03:18 There is full stack front end and
03:20 

03:20 backend engineer. I would select full
03:25 

03:25 stack engineer as well like system
03:28 

03:28 design turn into a game. Uh yeah it's
03:30 

03:30 basically I think that's the concept
03:32 

03:32 behind it. Uh but honestly I haven't
03:34 

03:34 gotten the game logic pad. I was just
03:36 

03:36 more focusing on how can these be used
03:38 

03:38 to explain tech uh easier on our
03:41 

03:41 podcast. That's how I came up with it.
03:42 

03:42 But um yeah, these were a really great
03:44 

03:44 start. At least I know the role cards,
03:46 

03:46 you know, make sense to Kentucky alike.
03:49 

03:49 So okay, you've kind of picked out a
03:51 

03:51 software engineer and within the
03:53 

03:53 software engineer expertise, you've
03:55 

03:55 picked out full stack where full stack
03:56 

03:56 means uh you cover pretty much uh yeah
03:60 

03:60 the the front end which is like the more
04:02 

04:02 UI changes, clicking buttons, calling
04:04 

04:04 APIs to fetch data as well as the back
04:07 

04:07 end which is sending the data over or
04:11 

04:11 making some changes on the on the system
04:13 

04:13 the database side.
04:14 

04:14 >> I also remembered that you said you you
04:16 

04:16 do prefer back end more. I know some
04:17 

04:17 people have
04:18 

04:18 >> I do prefer back end. Yes,
04:20 

04:20 >> I think this is always a never- ending
04:22 

04:22 debate between software engineers like
04:24 

04:24 where do you want to specialize in? Um
04:26 

04:26 the thing about full stack even I think
04:28 

04:28 fullstack is not like everyone is super
04:30 

04:30 like proficient in both. There will be
04:32 

04:32 moods where like you know each one to do
04:35 

04:35 one over the other.
04:36 

04:36 >> Yeah, I agree.
04:37 

04:37 >> It's a never- ending battle.
04:38 

04:38 >> That's true. But well to uh I want to
04:41 

04:41 help you elucidate your role better
04:43 

04:43 especially for people who just haven't
04:45 

04:45 been in the world uh of tech and also we
04:47 

04:47 we will be using uh these cards as we go
04:50 

04:50 along. So the next part um I want to
04:53 

04:53 introduce you to these idea cards. So
04:55 

04:55 you're going to pretend to do system
04:57 

04:57 design live in front of everybody. Uh
05:00 

05:00 these are a stack of uh app ideas. So
05:04 

05:04 very vague uh idea cards. Pick one. Pick
05:07 

05:07 one that you like. Does it have to be
05:09 

05:09 related to your uh job could be
05:12 

05:12 something that you
05:13 

05:13 >> whichever one interests you.
05:14 

05:14 >> Yeah. And you feel confident in it
05:16 

05:16 because well we're doing live demo now.
05:18 

05:18 So
05:19 

05:19 >> Ooh. Okay.
05:20 

05:20 >> We're just suddenly slapping a system
05:21 

05:21 design interview for you. I say you're
05:24 

05:24 interview ready.
05:26 

05:26 I do recommend people to be that does
05:29 

05:29 not mean I am. Uh but
05:33 

05:33 to be honest I have not seen these
05:35 

05:35 cards. We did not we did not go through
05:37 

05:37 this before. Uh but yes, I think I mean
05:40 

05:40 they're all very interesting systems but
05:43 

05:43 if I had to be like confident about one
05:46 

05:46 one such app I would say it would be
05:51 

05:51 maybe
05:52 

05:52 >> what are you debating between?
05:54 

05:54 >> So I do see a few finance related ones.
05:57 

05:57 >> Read it out. Read it out to
05:58 

05:58 >> So I do see one which is called pay
05:60 

06:00 beam. So, Paybeam is uh global payments
06:04 

06:04 for freelancers and small businesses and
06:07 

06:07 >> sounds familiar. Yeah,
06:09 

06:09 >> it sounds like
06:10 

06:10 >> it sounds kind of familiar.
06:11 

06:11 >> Kind of familiar.
06:12 

06:12 >> Paybeam. Yes. And also I mean there's
06:14 

06:14 this like trade route which also
06:17 

06:17 >> these are not real businesses by the
06:19 

06:19 way. These are not real apps.
06:20 

06:20 >> Yes. These are just uh names that we
06:23 

06:23 have come up with for generic apps. So,
06:26 

06:26 a trade route would be a fintech
06:27 

06:27 platform for international transfers
06:30 

06:30 with transparent fees
06:33 

06:33 and fast settlement.
06:35 

06:35 Um, pick one. Pick one. I would go for
06:39 

06:39 maybe
06:41 

06:41 if you don't have the luxury to pick,
06:42 

06:42 you know what?
06:43 

06:43 >> Trade route.
06:43 

06:43 >> Trade route. Okay. Why? Why?
06:46 

06:46 >> Just Just cuz it looks interesting. It
06:49 

06:49 looks generic enough for a fintech
06:50 

06:50 platform
06:51 

06:51 >> so we can see what what feature we want
06:53 

06:53 to do.
06:53 

06:53 >> Okay. last choice cuz there's the next
06:55 

06:55 step.
06:56 

06:56 >> Yeah,
06:56 

06:56 >> let's start.
06:58 

06:58 >> Confident.
06:58 

06:58 >> All right. So, to explain what a
07:00 

07:00 software engineer does, uh we're going
07:02 

07:02 to use uh an app example and also she's
07:06 

07:06 going to show you what she does in her
07:07 

07:07 role to actually build out this app. And
07:10 

07:10 uh instead of actually writing code, we
07:12 

07:12 have these system cards. So, these are
07:14 

07:14 cards that have uh different elements to
07:17 

07:17 building a an app, a software. uh you
07:20 

07:20 have things like data warehouse, server,
07:23 

07:23 you know, these technical terms that uh
07:25 

07:25 usually come up when you hear about
07:26 

07:26 software, but I'm not going to explain
07:29 

07:29 them. My lady here going to explain
07:32 

07:32 them, but you have to uh use it to build
07:35 

07:35 uh trade route.
07:36 

07:36 >> Okay. Okay. So, you can it's quite a
07:38 

07:38 thick stack, so you can just kind of
07:40 

07:40 maybe flip through it and see what's
07:41 

07:41 relevant and then you can kind of
07:43 

07:43 verbalize, wow, this is really
07:44 

07:44 interview. Yeah,
07:45 

07:45 >> no pressure. um just keep it
07:47 

07:47 minimalistic if you don't have time to
07:49 

07:49 go deep dive.
07:50 

07:50 >> Okay. So I do see really generic system
07:54 

07:54 design components. So like database
07:56 

07:56 would definitely be one that I would be
07:58 

07:58 working with. Uh actually dashboard
08:03 

08:03 model API m exposes machine learning
08:06 

08:06 models. Okay. No I don't I wouldn't be
08:08 

08:08 going into machine learning and stuff.
08:11 

08:11 >> Not right now. Yeah.
08:11 

08:11 >> Another episode maybe. API gateway is
08:14 

08:14 very common commonly used. Payments API
08:17 

08:17 is something I would definitely need. Uh
08:20 

08:20 a server,
08:22 

08:22 why not?
08:23 

08:23 >> Well, on prem or cloud. There's als so
08:25 

08:25 so cloud load balancer cloud hosting.
08:28 

08:28 >> Oh wow, look at all the C. Pick out the
08:30 

08:30 like 1 2 3 4 5 6. Do I have to system
08:33 

08:33 like this is complicated?
08:34 

08:34 >> Yeah, it is a very complicated system
08:36 

08:36 and also right now trade route seems
08:39 

08:39 like really huge. we'll probably focus
08:41 

08:41 in on a particular portion and then
08:44 

08:44 it'll be more relevant. So maybe I think
08:47 

08:47 for now this will be enough to create
08:49 

08:49 something.
08:50 

08:50 >> Okay. Uh so basically now we've picked
08:52 

08:52 out the elements in your job. How do you
08:56 

08:56 like architect and put these elements
08:58 

08:58 together? You can maybe pick out say
08:60 

08:60 like oh I'm working on the database and
09:02 

09:02 the API gateway and now I have to write
09:04 

09:04 APIs uh for this specific function in
09:07 

09:07 trade route. like what do you do in your
09:10 

09:10 your day-to-day or if you were working
09:11 

09:11 on trade route and you can kind of
09:13 

09:13 assume a feature usual day-to-day as a
09:16 

09:16 software developer at trade route I
09:19 

09:19 would be working on CRUD operations
09:22 

09:22 maybe I'll be creating APIs and
09:25 

09:25 obviously payments related APIs you want
09:27 

09:27 to explain what cred is cuz I know cred
09:29 

09:29 sounds
09:30 

09:30 >> create read update delete these are
09:33 

09:33 basically just uh functionalities that
09:36 

09:36 can be done on a system so you can
09:38 

09:38 either create something. So in this
09:40 

09:40 case, create a payment, you can update a
09:42 

09:42 payment, you can read a payment like
09:44 

09:44 view what is this payment all about or
09:47 

09:47 you can delete a payment. So very on
09:51 

09:51 point with uh the fintech platform. Uh
09:55 

09:55 so yeah, that's that's something we'll
09:57 

09:57 be doing daytoday. And how do we write
09:59 

09:59 these payment APIs is I I'm more of a
10:03 

10:03 Java person. I would use a Java language
10:06 

10:06 to write uh a certain yeah these APIs
10:10 

10:10 either fix them, enhance them, create a
10:13 

10:13 new API and then these APIs are then
10:16 

10:16 deployed on servers.
10:19 

10:19 So yeah, these APIs are deployed on
10:22 

10:22 servers and the servers are sitting on
10:24 

10:24 something like cloud hosting.
10:27 

10:27 I love it that I can like put one on top
10:29 

10:29 of the other. It's literally a tech
10:31 

10:31 stack. Oh, that's a good one. That's a
10:33 

10:33 good one. I think that's a good name
10:34 

10:34 text the name direct right and then of
10:38 

10:38 course these payments APIs would need a
10:41 

10:41 database
10:42 

10:42 uh because all these payments are stored
10:44 

10:44 in a database so payments API talks to
10:47 

10:47 the database all this lives on a server
10:50 

10:50 which is cloud hosted
10:53 

10:53 done my day job
10:54 

10:54 >> this is this is great you literally like
10:56 

10:56 I I think you're kind of having fun with
10:58 

10:58 this right
10:58 

10:58 >> it is it is quite fun actually
11:00 

11:00 >> I like do another one
11:02 

11:02 >> there's other parts of it because now
11:04 

11:04 you've kind of uh used this stack to
11:06 

11:06 explain what you do as a software
11:07 

11:07 engineer. Hopefully to the non- techies
11:09 

11:09 out there, this makes it uh more uh uh
11:11 

11:11 uh relevant to um you um but the next
11:15 

11:15 part which is actually the title of the
11:17 

11:17 episode, right? AI isn't taking my job.
11:20 

11:20 I wanted to ask uh do you use AI in your
11:23 

11:23 day-to-day and also how do you use them?
11:25 

11:25 We've also we also have some tools cards
11:28 

11:28 and in them there are like uh AI tools
11:31 

11:31 as well. So you can um pick a couple if
11:34 

11:34 you feel like that's what you use. Can
11:36 

11:36 pick one or two to help you explain how
11:38 

11:38 you use AI in your job.
11:39 

11:39 >> I would like to say my job is not
11:41 

11:41 everything to me. I have a 5 to9 after
11:43 

11:43 my 9 to5. So but I do code both in 9 to5
11:48 

11:48 and 5 to9. Obviously I do use AI uh for
11:52 

11:52 coding definitely because if you don't
11:55 

11:55 it's not good. You should be using AI to
11:57 

11:57 be coding already by now. Like contrary
11:60 

11:60 to like popular belief, AI is not really
12:03 

12:03 like replacing replacing me. It is
12:05 

12:05 actually enhancing what I'm doing. So it
12:07 

12:07 actually makes me really productive.
12:08 

12:08 Okay. Like for example, Copilot.
12:11 

12:11 I think Copilot is like the simplest of
12:13 

12:13 AI tools out there. Uh it definitely is
12:17 

12:17 uh able to autocomplete a lot of my
12:20 

12:20 code. So I'll just be writing like
12:22 

12:22 halfway and then it'll autocomplete the
12:24 

12:24 rest of the code for me. So it and most
12:28 

12:28 of the time it is actually correct
12:29 

12:29 because it's actually reading from the
12:31 

12:31 rest of the code repository and
12:32 

12:32 therefore it's able to come up with a
12:34 

12:34 very good code autocomplete which is
12:37 

12:37 inconsistent with like the rest of the
12:39 

12:39 codebase. So copilot is one AI tool that
12:42 

12:42 I definitely use daily.
12:44 

12:44 >> Do you use it for vibe coding as well or
12:46 

12:46 just for the auto completion?
12:47 

12:47 >> We have a vibe coding. Oh cuz that's
12:49 

12:49 right. So bipe coding bipe coding as I
12:53 

12:53 see it is actually this concept of uh
12:57 

12:57 telling a tool exactly what you want to
13:00 

13:00 do like create this app or fix this bug
13:03 

13:03 and then it itself goes about doing that
13:06 

13:06 fix for you. So that's called wipe
13:08 

13:08 coding. So you are actually just talking
13:09 

13:09 to an AI and it does the thing for you.
13:11 

13:11 That's how I see wipe coding. And yes,
13:14 

13:14 sometimes I do use this uh this as well
13:18 

13:18 where I'll just be telling it what I
13:19 

13:19 want it to do or maybe I'll just be like
13:21 

13:21 actually having a discussion with it
13:23 

13:23 like this is what I intend to do and
13:25 

13:25 this is the problem solving. Does this
13:27 

13:27 make sense? Do you have any other uh you
13:30 

13:30 know opinions or something or something
13:32 

13:32 I missed out? So I do use wipe coding in
13:35 

13:35 that way.
13:36 

13:36 >> That makes sense. So I think these are
13:37 

13:37 tools that a lot of other software
13:39 

13:39 engineers like I use them too and I
13:40 

13:40 believe you use them uh as a solutions
13:42 

13:42 engineer. Another episode um and uh it
13:46 

13:46 seems from what you have said you've
13:47 

13:47 already said this that you feel like
13:49 

13:49 they don't replace but these tools
13:51 

13:51 empower you as a developer. Well beyond
13:54 

13:54 that though while they empower you is
13:57 

13:57 there a part of your job that you feel
13:59 

13:59 like AI can never replace if you want
14:02 

14:02 only if you want an eight. These are
14:04 

14:04 challenge cards but you know if they
14:06 

14:06 relate to your specific situation you
14:08 

14:08 feel like AI will never be able to solve
14:10 

14:10 these challenges. These kind of
14:11 

14:11 challenge are real life challenges.
14:14 

14:14 >> Yeah. So there's like scaling failure.
14:16 

14:16 You can't deploy new systems this time.
14:18 

14:18 So how would you go about do uh solving
14:21 

14:21 this? What for server crashes? Uh but I
14:24 

14:24 mean but if the question is about what
14:26 

14:26 can AI not replace exactly? All these AI
14:30 

14:30 agents and these kind they are all
14:32 

14:32 programs. So they can to some extent do
14:35 

14:35 what you tell it to do if it do if you
14:37 

14:37 tell it properly. So I wouldn't say it
14:40 

14:40 it can't exactly do exactly what I'm
14:42 

14:42 doing, but maybe it can't do it as well
14:43 

14:43 as me or as well as humans would in a
14:48 

14:48 setting maybe because a lot of these
14:50 

14:50 things require a lot of uh
14:52 

14:52 communication. What makes me a soft this
14:55 

14:55 software developer that I am is all of
14:58 

14:58 the life experiences and the work
15:01 

15:01 experiences and the communication and
15:04 

15:04 relationships I have with all these
15:05 

15:05 other software developers that's in me
15:07 

15:07 that makes me able to do things a
15:09 

15:09 certain way that I would I don't know if
15:12 

15:12 I can if you can give all of these
15:14 

15:14 things into a AI agent and then create a
15:17 

15:17 replica of a software developer right so
15:21 

15:21 not entirely I can't I I mean I I can't
15:23 

15:23 put words to what is missing.
15:25 

15:25 >> Right. Right.
15:26 

15:26 >> Uh but it's the entirety of a human
15:30 

15:30 software. So I kind of want to throw a
15:32 

15:32 curveball here because um you mentioned
15:34 

15:34 how you know your day-to-day job is this
15:36 

15:36 tech stack. All right. So technically
15:38 

15:38 yes you are a unique individual right
15:40 

15:40 but is that necessary for the work that
15:43 

15:43 you're doing right now? Because you
15:44 

15:44 mentioned like the AI would definitely
15:46 

15:46 not have your unique experiences
15:48 

15:48 individual uh cultural social cues
15:51 

15:51 values and all that. But is that needed
15:53 

15:53 for the job that you're currently doing
15:55 

15:55 right now?
15:56 

15:56 >> That's a good question.
15:57 

15:57 >> And so a lot of a lot of task that I do
15:59 

15:59 daily maybe not because they are
16:01 

16:01 probably repeatable and they are uh in
16:04 

16:04 nuanced in a way that it can be managed.
16:06 

16:06 But a lot of things for for example a
16:09 

16:09 senior software will be able to think of
16:11 

16:11 other scenarios where this particular
16:13 

16:13 feature might break or uh it there could
16:17 

16:17 be past experience that has happened in
16:19 

16:19 a company in this particular nuance
16:22 

16:22 feature
16:22 

16:22 >> right a very specific content
16:23 

16:23 >> that correct that for for example
16:26 

16:26 actually so then one of your thing comes
16:28 

16:28 up like feature creep for example I'm
16:32 

16:32 already working on a feature to uh send
16:35 

16:35 out money from uh one person to another
16:38 

16:38 and I already know when this happens
16:41 

16:41 billions of users will start using it
16:43 

16:43 suddenly because it's it's so fast in a
16:45 

16:45 second you get money from one end to end
16:47 

16:47 and and then people and then we have
16:49 

16:49 other like product managers or other
16:52 

16:52 other teams coming up to us saying like
16:54 

16:54 oh can you also help us do this at at a
16:56 

16:56 cost to it add this to that all this to
16:58 

16:58 it that's called feature creep and only
17:01 

17:01 like a person who has gone through this
17:03 

17:03 cycle a couple of times will be able to
17:05 

17:05 identif identify what's a feature creep
17:07 

17:07 and what is not a feature creep. What is
17:08 

17:08 actually a useful thing to add to the
17:10 

17:10 feature at the moment. And I think
17:13 

17:13 you're definitely right cuz if an AI
17:14 

17:14 were to do this, they'll probably just
17:16 

17:16 try to do everything. They'll think
17:17 

17:17 everything is an instruction and they'll
17:19 

17:19 just keep running and then adding adding
17:20 

17:20 adding without realizing that this is
17:23 

17:23 all uh choking up the system actually.
17:25 

17:25 So uh this is where humans actually come
17:27 

17:27 into play. I mean you did say that you
17:29 

17:29 work not just in a silo, you work with
17:31 

17:31 so many other people. So communication
17:32 

17:32 is this really big part about being a
17:35 

17:35 software engineer. Uh and that's not
17:37 

17:37 something that AI can immediately
17:38 

17:38 replace.
17:39 

17:39 >> Yeah.
17:39 

17:39 >> Yeah.
17:39 

17:39 >> And there's very very specific knowledge
17:41 

17:41 that has to be put into these agents
17:44 

17:44 that are going to be running this this
17:47 

17:47 feature for example that will make it
17:51 

17:51 replaced replace an entire team.
17:53 

17:53 >> No, that's true.
17:54 

17:54 >> A tech team, right?
17:55 

17:55 >> Yeah. I guess at the end of the day uh
17:57 

17:57 while a big uh good thing about AI is
17:60 

17:60 that it knows everything it's like a
18:02 

18:02 jack of all trades trades but master of
18:04 

18:04 none master of not one single context
18:07 

18:07 and that's where being you asked about
18:08 

18:08 being unique does that help and being a
18:11 

18:11 unique software engineer uh having this
18:13 

18:13 unique experience that you've gone
18:14 

18:14 through uh you wouldn't uh you you would
18:17 

18:17 be able to give more uh opinionated
18:19 

18:19 advice uh when certain situations happen
18:22 

18:22 based on that specific context whereas
18:23 

18:23 AI would need to like source through its
18:26 

18:26 like vast context to see what's
18:29 

18:29 relevant.
18:30 

18:30 >> Yeah. And I mean I would like to give
18:31 

18:31 like an example of this, right? So uh on
18:34 

18:34 a day-to-day basis, I use AI tools on
18:36 

18:36 the side when when I'm working. And a
18:39 

18:39 lot of times if I just had to rely on
18:41 

18:41 what they tell me, uh what it tells me
18:44 

18:44 off my prompt, uh a lot of times they're
18:47 

18:47 actually wrong cuz they need all this
18:49 

18:49 extra information like, "But what about
18:51 

18:51 this? Did you consider this?" And then
18:52 

18:52 it's always like, "Oh, yeah, you are
18:54 

18:54 right. I did not consider this. Oh yeah,
18:56 

18:56 you're right. I did not consider." Cuz
18:58 

18:58 how much can you put in the prompt,
19:00 

19:00 right? Uh it's it's only that much that
19:02 

19:02 it can be able to think of. So that
19:06 

19:06 that's where I'm coming from. uh
19:08 

19:08 basically that even though there are
19:11 

19:11 these tools out there that that have
19:13 

19:13 these infinite uh potential for it, you
19:16 

19:16 would still need a human to give it,
19:20 

19:20 prompt it, lead it, guide it in a
19:22 

19:22 certain manner.
19:23 

19:23 >> Yeah. No, I definitely agree. And I
19:26 

19:26 think like basically you've uh already
19:28 

19:28 clarified you don't think AI is going to
19:30 

19:30 take your job as a software engineer.
19:32 

19:32 And uh as a whole you're it's it's
19:34 

19:34 really refreshing to hear somebody be
19:35 

19:35 more excited about AI than afraid of it.
19:38 

19:38 And I think that's the kind of energy we
19:39 

19:39 want to bring uh into this room and also
19:42 

19:42 to those uh watches who are uh watching
19:44 

19:44 and listening to us right now. I think
19:47 

19:47 this was a really great episode. You
19:48 

19:48 summarized being a software engineer
19:50 

19:50 really well when being a software
19:51 

19:51 engineer is so complex. I hope the cards
19:53 

19:53 helped you. We're actually prototyping
19:55 

19:55 these uh for a sort of card game to help
19:58 

19:58 people um see uh uh system design as a
20:02 

20:02 game uh rather than something boring
20:05 

20:05 that like coders do. So yeah, do stay
20:07 

20:07 tuned to us. You will see these cards
20:09 

20:09 again hopefully in a more improved
20:10 

20:10 version uh not on construction colored
20:13 

20:13 paper laminate. But uh yes, as always,
20:16 

20:16 this was React Tech. Thank you so much
20:18 

20:18 for tuning in. Remember to follow all
