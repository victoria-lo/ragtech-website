00:04 

00:04 hi everyone and welcome back to Rag Tech
00:07 

00:07 where we dive into real life topics in
00:09 

00:09 Tech today we are excited to introduce a
00:12 

00:12 brand new type of episode we're calling
00:14 

00:14 Tech tutoring in this series will tackle
00:17 

00:17 leet code problems the kinds of coding
00:19 

00:19 challenges software Engineers often face
00:21 

00:21 in technical interviews but don't worry
00:24 

00:24 this isn't Just For Engineers these
00:26 

00:26 problems are like brain teasers perfect
00:28 

00:28 for anyone curious about the problem
00:30 

00:30 solving site of tech for this first
00:32 

00:32 episode we've chosen a classic Le cat
00:35 

00:35 question container with the most water
00:38 

00:38 it's an approachable problem that's
00:39 

00:39 great for beginners but still highlights
00:42 

00:42 the strategies Engineers use every day
00:44 

00:44 plus it's a fun way to explore
00:46 

00:46 algorithms without getting too deep into
00:48 

00:48 complex math whether you're prepping for
00:50 

00:50 interviews learning something new or
00:53 

00:53 just here for the ride we hope you enjoy
00:55 

00:55 this special episode let's jump
00:58 

00:58 in my name is Toria I'm a Solutions
01:01 

01:01 engineer I'm sonone a software engineer
01:04 

01:04 and today we'll be doing a new type of
01:06 

01:06 content where we're actually going to
01:08 

01:08 have Sone explain a Leal question and
01:12 

01:12 teach it to me so without further Ado
01:14 

01:14 sonone so today's question is going to
01:17 

01:17 be uh it's on lead code and this is
01:19 

01:19 container with most water so very simply
01:23 

01:23 explained that we have like a bar bar
01:26 

01:26 graph and we want to find what is the
01:29 

01:29 largest are between two bars and that's
01:34 

01:34 a problem and there are like practical
01:36 

01:36 applications of such problems you can
01:39 

01:39 think of like in networking there are
01:41 

01:41 different notes which are different
01:42 

01:42 routers in place and between these notes
01:46 

01:46 there is a cost to connect to the next
01:48 

01:48 node so you can think of the cost as the
01:51 

01:51 height and therefore you want to get
01:53 

01:53 like the minimum cost or the maximum
01:55 

01:55 cost so that's one application of such
01:58 

01:58 without further Ado uh this is how I
02:02 

02:02 would go about like solving this
02:03 

02:03 question we see that we have uh integer
02:06 

02:06 array of the height and we want to
02:09 

02:09 return integer which is the maximum
02:12 

02:12 amount of water and maximum amount of
02:14 

02:14 water would be height times uh the the
02:18 

02:18 width yeah okay so uh let's look at an
02:22 

02:22 example here I usually use commments so
02:25 

02:25 I use this to comment and now we have
02:28 

02:28 this so these are the heights first L
02:29 

02:29 you know that have to choose two bars so
02:32 

02:32 in between the two bars that's the array
02:34 

02:34 it seems quite obvious to start with two
02:37 

02:37 pointers like one at the starting and
02:40 

02:40 one at the end so one over here using
02:44 

02:44 the first okay I like that they have
02:46 

02:46 this example this image here so using
02:48 

02:48 this one and this seven to calculate the
02:51 

02:51 area between these two it would be the
02:55 

02:55 array index here minus the array index
02:58 

02:58 here which will give us one 1 2 3 4 5 6
03:02 

03:02 7 eight so eight times one only and one
03:06 

03:06 because it is the minimum of the two
03:09 

03:09 lens right so that's how you calculate
03:12 

03:12 the area the minimum Bar times the
03:16 

03:16 distance between the two indexes so that
03:19 

03:19 that sounds good yeah so now if we have
03:21 

03:21 these two array pointers the first one
03:24 

03:24 and the last one we just calculate the
03:28 

03:28 current area maybe M so that would be 1
03:34 

03:34 time8 I calculated eight right this not
03:37 

03:37 yep yeah so one
03:39 

03:39 times8 so that is eight So currently the
03:42 

03:42 the maximum is also eight so we just
03:45 

03:45 also store the max which is also eight
03:49 

03:49 and then we will
03:51 

03:51 move we should move the one which is
03:55 

03:55 lower so since the first one is lower we
03:58 

03:58 move this one h cuz you want to find the
04:01 

04:01 max area right yeah so we move the one
04:03 

04:03 which is lower yeah so in this case now
04:05 

04:05 we have eight so now the current area
04:08 

04:08 becomes uh eight and seven seven is
04:11 

04:11 lower so seven times the distance
04:14 

04:14 between eight the index of8 and seven is
04:17 

04:17 seven because just minus one from the
04:20 

04:20 previous now it is
04:22 

04:22 49 okay so that's definitely the max
04:25 

04:25 area now I'll replace the max area then
04:28 

04:28 now because seven is lower I will bring
04:31 

04:31 this one down so between eight and three
04:34 

04:34 it would be three is the height so uh
04:37 

04:37 three
04:39 

04:39 times uh six this time so 18 is still
04:44 

04:44 lower than the max area it doesn't
04:46 

04:46 change yeah so I'll just keep doing this
04:49 

04:49 in that particular Manner and the max
04:51 

04:51 area is your answer yeah sounds good
04:54 

04:54 that would be the Brute Force way right
04:56 

04:56 like that's when I first at this
04:57 

04:57 question that's the thing that comes to
04:59 

04:59 my mind and and I feel it's not that bad
05:02 

05:02 because I actually just went through the
05:03 

05:03 array one time o complexity as well so
05:07 

05:07 I'll start implementing this let's go
05:10 

05:10 okay so we can start with initializing
05:14 

05:14 some of our variables so we have integer
05:18 

05:18 current area this is Java we have to put
05:20 

05:20 a semicolon behind so if not it's a
05:23 

05:23 syntax error so this is how it is now
05:26 

05:26 I'm using JavaScript at work so bear
05:29 

05:29 with me H and then I also need like a
05:33 

05:33 left and right pointer so I'll just call
05:34 

05:34 it left and right and the left is index
05:38 

05:38 zero and the right is index height uh
05:43 

05:43 height array is length I think yeah
05:47 

05:47 minus one minus one yeah so then while
05:52 

05:52 we have left is always less than the
05:55 

05:55 right because once it's equal you have
05:58 

05:58 finished all your combinations already
06:01 

06:01 right so the while left is less than
06:04 

06:04 right I would start getting I need
06:07 

06:07 another pointer for the actual indexes
06:09 

06:09 so let's just call it IJ if you don't
06:12 

06:12 mind my lack of variable so height of
06:17 

06:17 left M and oops J would be height of
06:23 

06:23 right
06:25 

06:25 and with that we now do our calculation
06:27 

06:27 which we want to find which is the
06:28 

06:28 minimum index which is but there's this
06:31 

06:31 math do mean that we can use m i and J
06:35 

06:35 and then we calculate the current area
06:38 

06:38 actually even though I put a current
06:40 

06:40 area there is just within this so we
06:43 

06:43 actually don't need this right so
06:46 

06:46 integer current area would just be
06:48 

06:48 minimum times the index difference right
06:52 

06:52 and index in this case is left and right
06:56 

06:56 yeah which is just right minus left
06:59 

06:59 because right is more and left yep so
07:01 

07:01 that is the current area and then we do
07:02 

07:02 a simple if current area is more than
07:08 

07:08 Max area we replace the max area Max are
07:12 

07:12 equals to current area there's some
07:14 

07:14 noise in the
07:16 

07:16 background it's okay we have mic uh I
07:20 

07:20 guess yes so that's the gist of it
07:24 

07:24 and uh if I just go through this then I
07:27 

07:27 also need to move the one that that is
07:30 

07:30 lower for the next iteration so how do I
07:34 

07:34 decide which one I move is if the right
07:39 

07:39 looking back at my example I moved seven
07:43 

07:43 was s is smaller than eight so that
07:47 

07:47 means I and J so if I
07:52 

07:52 is we already have the minimum if
07:55 

07:55 minimum is I then you do i++
08:00 

08:00 else I don't know no this is with
08:04 

08:04 JavaScript so I'll have to put this here
08:07 

08:07 then else if you see as software the opp
08:10 

08:10 we always get confused with two
08:11 

08:11 different programming languages if
08:13 

08:13 that's what is happening at work uh but
08:17 

08:17 no nothing to worry not i++ but actually
08:20 

08:20 it's a left Plus+ yeah the pointer yeah
08:23 

08:23 the yeah the index itself the index yeah
08:25 

08:25 that's why namings are important if I
08:27 

08:27 had named the left Index right index
08:30 

08:30 makes more sense and then return
08:32 

08:32 statement would be here return Max area
08:36 

08:36 I think it looks good should we go
08:38 

08:38 through it to we just ironic as a slead
08:40 

08:40 Cod and we are not in an actual
08:42 

08:42 interview okay yeah let's just keep it
08:45 

08:45 casual let's just run it and see and
08:47 

08:47 hopefully I think yeah I think what you
08:50 

08:50 say makes sense okay y because this is a
08:52 

08:52 pretty easy uh solution and we did run
08:54 

08:54 it before yeah yeah that's why I think
08:57 

08:57 with all Le C questions that's how we
08:59 

08:59 should do it we should not just rush
09:01 

09:01 into like writing the code we should
09:03 

09:03 think through it validate your
09:05 

09:05 solutioning on talk through the I also
09:08 

09:08 think this also helped the interviewer
09:10 

09:10 or the other person to understand what I
09:12 

09:12 was going to do next I definitely
09:14 

09:14 understand like your code and how you
09:15 

09:15 implement it because I heard your
09:17 

09:17 thought process before so it makes it
09:19 

09:19 more structur easy for me to follow as
09:22 

09:22 well if I were the interviewer and I
09:24 

09:24 also can see how you thought through
09:26 

09:26 step by step right wow so thank you so
09:29 

09:29 much Lon for explaining and I like how
09:31 

09:31 you particularly relate a leak code
09:35 

09:35 question to like an application in real
09:37 

09:37 world because I think a lot of Le Cod
09:39 

09:39 questions they are quite abstract and
09:41 

09:41 it'll make you feel kind of like why do
09:43 

09:43 I need this why do I need to solve this
09:45 

09:45 there was more motivation after I found
09:47 

09:47 out that it makes sense to solve this
09:50 

09:50 question yeah so yeah I think um yeah I
09:54 

09:54 hope this was a helpful episode yeah and
09:57 

09:57 uh if you like such episodes do comment
09:60 

09:60 let us know what do you like what what
10:01 

10:01 do you like about this and if you have
10:03 

10:03 special questions that you would like us
10:04 

10:04 to answer as well we will get the
10:07 

10:07 challenge get on the challenge and yeah
10:11 

10:11 thank you for watching and thank you bye
10:13 

10:13 bye please follow subscribe to rec by
