00:01 no we were discussing that should we ask
00:02 

00:02 you me to like change like two the for
00:06 

00:06 you fashion
00:10 

00:10 [Music]
00:13 

00:13 show hello everyone welcome to rec tag
00:16 

00:16 the place for bites and banter I'm Salon
00:18 

00:18 software engineer I'm Victoria Solutions
00:21 

00:21 engineer and today we have a guest
00:23 

00:23 speaker y she is also software engineer
00:26 

00:26 and today we we'll be talking about
00:29 

00:29 career tips and self- evaluation tips
00:32 

00:32 and how we can get promoted and learn a
00:34 

00:34 bit more from Yin uh so let's start with
00:38 

00:38 I ask about one-on ones so let's start
00:41 

00:41 with that uh in my team we usually have
00:44 

00:44 one-on ones with every team member uh
00:47 

00:47 especially our team lead so the team
00:49 

00:49 member one is voluntary if you want you
00:51 

00:51 can have them uh it's optional as well
00:54 

00:54 uh but the more important one I I guess
00:56 

00:56 is the one with my team lead where we
00:58 

00:58 will talk about our milestone what we
01:01 

01:01 have reached and uh there are some some
01:04 

01:04 times where I actually do not have
01:06 

01:06 anything to add to our meeting so we'll
01:09 

01:09 cancel it or you know we'll just talk
01:11 

01:11 about what how things are going but
01:14 

01:14 would you have any tips on how you go
01:17 

01:17 about your one-on ones and any advice
01:19 

01:19 for like uh People Like Us who are
01:21 

01:21 trying and grow up the L yeah sure um I
01:24 

01:24 think the one-on ones they're very
01:26 

01:26 special relationship and it depends on
01:29 

01:29 how you like to to operate how you like
01:32 

01:32 to receive feedback how you like to give
01:33 

01:33 feedback um and how your engineering
01:35 

01:35 manager or your team lead is able to you
01:38 

01:38 know kind of where where you're able to
01:40 

01:40 align on those things I start off when I
01:43 

01:43 especially when I have a new one-on-one
01:46 

01:46 uh relationship I start off with a
01:47 

01:47 document because I'm also a planner and
01:49 

01:49 I like to I'm also a very visual person
01:52 

01:52 and my memory is just not the best so I
01:54 

01:54 like to come in with an agenda of maybe
01:57 

01:57 a subset of questions that um I like to
01:59 

01:59 go through
02:00 

02:00 and to start off you can look for some
02:02 

02:02 templates online they have really good
02:04 

02:04 questions for one-on ones and if you run
02:06 

02:06 out of things to say you can always
02:07 

02:07 touch on those points so I always leave
02:08 

02:08 them at the bottom and I highlight the
02:10 

02:10 ones that I do want to talk about that's
02:12 

02:12 maybe pertinent to our project that
02:13 

02:13 we're working on something that I
02:15 

02:15 experienced recently and then the other
02:17 

02:17 you know so-called um backup questions I
02:20 

02:20 always have in my tool box and I usually
02:24 

02:24 you know take some questions that I have
02:26 

02:26 with other one-on ones and kind of wrote
02:28 

02:28 them in as well they they never have to
02:29 

02:29 know
02:30 

02:30 um that I I found like you know
02:32 

02:32 personally very helpful um in terms of
02:36 

02:36 you know tips with getting those one-on
02:38 

02:38 ones towards a direction trending
02:40 

02:40 towards a promotion or trending towards
02:42 

02:42 career growth it really does stem from
02:45 

02:45 the types of questions you ask and also
02:48 

02:48 them understanding like your motivation
02:50 

02:50 behind those questions so I found it
02:52 

02:52 very helpful to at least highlight my
02:54 

02:54 motivation behind a question um for
02:57 

02:57 example I am looking for a staff role in
03:01 

03:01 the future I don't know how I can
03:04 

03:04 increase my impact or since you're the
03:07 

03:07 team lead do you see any opportunities
03:09 

03:09 for me to step up into are you lacking
03:11 

03:11 any um support in certain areas that you
03:14 

03:14 know I can probably help out it with um
03:17 

03:17 other things could be um you know
03:21 

03:21 talking about your strengths and talking
03:22 

03:22 about your limitations or talking about
03:24 

03:24 your comfort zone what are some things
03:26 

03:26 that you are very comfortable doing
03:28 

03:28 you've done multiple times and you your
03:29 

03:29 team
03:30 

03:30 can trust you to do or can those also be
03:33 

03:33 seen as opportunities for other team
03:36 

03:36 members in your other one-on ones are
03:38 

03:38 those opportunities that hey I've done
03:39 

03:39 this like multiple times I feel very
03:41 

03:41 comfortable but I do think that it'll be
03:43 

03:43 great to kind of you know share the
03:45 

03:45 knowledge um would you be interested in
03:48 

03:48 helping me with that can I help you
03:50 

03:50 maybe hand some things over so in that
03:52 

03:52 way you're you're giving more room for
03:54 

03:54 others to grow then you're removing
03:56 

03:56 yourself from always being that go-to
03:58 

03:58 person for this particular task um then
04:02 

04:02 making space for yourself to take on
04:03 

04:03 something else so it's it's like a very
04:05 

04:05 you know you're kind of like moving the
04:07 

04:07 things over to someone else but but
04:09 

04:09 offering them an opportunity to learn
04:12 

04:12 and then you're making space for you to
04:14 

04:14 take something else on so you know from
04:16 

04:16 the team wide perspective nothing's
04:18 

04:18 being dropped you're just shifting
04:20 

04:20 responsibilities right um that is also
04:23 

04:23 important for your team lead to know
04:25 

04:25 like hey I was thinking maybe Brian
04:27 

04:27 might be interested in this opportunity
04:29 

04:29 I've talked to them before
04:30 

04:30 um since I'm handing that off to them do
04:32 

04:32 you think I can look into something else
04:34 

04:34 and maybe uh get more experience in XYZ
04:37 

04:37 right so that's how I like to go about
04:39 

04:39 doing my one-on ones um when especially
04:41 

04:41 if I'm wrapping something up and other
04:44 

04:44 things I would like to ask is like
04:46 

04:46 you're a team lead right how did you get
04:47 

04:47 to that position how did how was your
04:50 

04:50 journey in that because if you're
04:51 

04:51 interested in going to that position the
04:53 

04:53 best thing is to ask the person who's
04:54 

04:54 already in that position and you know
04:56 

04:56 learn about their Journeys getting there
04:58 

04:58 um so there's other kinds of questions I
05:00 

05:00 would ask to is about them and people
05:02 

05:02 like talking about themselves what other
05:04 

05:04 better way to establish right that
05:06 

05:06 relationship than to really show the
05:08 

05:08 interest and you are genuinely
05:09 

05:09 interested in how they got there um and
05:11 

05:11 and hearing from their perspective um
05:14 

05:14 sometimes yeah I think you know I I
05:16 

05:16 haven't really canceled one or months
05:18 

05:18 unless I'm going out on vacation or my
05:20 

05:20 my manager or somebody else is also
05:22 

05:22 going on vacation of course we can
05:23 

05:23 reschedule but I do like to keep like
05:27 

05:27 keep them as much as I can because I
05:29 

05:29 feel like when you go too long without a
05:30 

05:30 one-on-one it feels like oh that
05:32 

05:32 relationship that you work so hard to
05:34 

05:34 establish is now like going back like
05:37 

05:37 you you're digressing uh diverging again
05:40 

05:40 um of course it also depends on like
05:43 

05:43 what you want out that one-onone yeah I
05:45 

05:45 think a lot of the questions you ask
05:46 

05:46 really depend on what you want out of
05:47 

05:47 the one-on-one I see yeah uh like even
05:51 

05:51 in like when I have my one-on-one uh it
05:54 

05:54 it usually starts off with like oh how
05:56 

05:56 are you doing uh and I realize it's so
05:60 

05:60 one on one I would also make sure that I
06:01 

06:01 also ask him or her back like you know
06:04 

06:04 how are you like like I say you would
06:06 

06:06 like to ask me but then I also want to
06:08 

06:08 learn about you right how are you doing
06:11 

06:11 as well it's not just like a lead to a
06:14 

06:14 you know a junior person it it could be
06:17 

06:17 okay we are both colleagues in this
06:20 

06:20 team is your workload also too much then
06:23 

06:23 I'll also understand oh actually you're
06:24 

06:24 actually doing that many other things
06:26 

06:26 maybe I can you know help you do do this
06:29 

06:29 and like spin step in a bit so there was
06:31 

06:31 a lot of things that I learned uh
06:34 

06:34 thinking that it's a two-way thing it's
06:35 

06:35 not a oneway thing very good point very
06:37 

06:37 good point yeah exactly then um maybe I
06:40 

06:40 can ask both of you this because I know
06:42 

06:42 you mentioned about building that rapper
06:45 

06:45 building that relationship like for me I
06:47 

06:47 guess when I have one-on ones it's more
06:49 

06:49 like it's professional and work related
06:52 

06:52 like we did ask how are you but it'll be
06:54 

06:54 like in work related things how do you I
06:57 

06:57 don't know maybe be closer to someone
07:01 

07:01 like you know like for me I share a
07:03 

07:03 little bit like outside work just just a
07:06 

07:06 little bit hoping they'll share back
07:08 

07:08 right like maybe my blog or things that
07:10 

07:10 I'm doing like outside work but still
07:13 

07:13 kind of work related so I was thinking
07:16 

07:16 what are your um perspectives on this
07:18 

07:18 and like what is a good Cadence for
07:20 

07:20 one-on-one yeah I think to start a
07:23 

07:23 weekly Cadence with someone that you're
07:25 

07:25 not familiar with works if it's someone
07:27 

07:27 you're very familiar with and you may
07:29 

07:29 have at talk like you know sometimes I
07:31 

07:31 have a coworker we used to have
07:32 

07:32 scheduled one-on once but we found that
07:34 

07:34 we were already like pairing on things
07:36 

07:36 like it didn't make sense to have this
07:38 

07:38 one-onone on our calendar for the sake
07:40 

07:40 of having it since we were more
07:42 

07:42 comfortable with ad hoc so we canceled
07:43 

07:43 the scheduled ones but we have our ad
07:45 

07:45 hoc ones um with my manager we had
07:47 

07:47 weekly ones and I found that a good
07:49 

07:49 Cadence sometimes if I'm feeling too
07:51 

07:51 burnt out I might request maybe a Bi
07:53 

07:53 weekly one-on once but I always feel
07:56 

07:56 like for your career um standpoint you
07:59 

07:59 want to make sure that your manager also
07:60 

08:00 knows what you're up to a lot of times
08:02 

08:02 people are just um you just know what
08:05 

08:05 you've worked on the most you're the
08:07 

08:07 most familiar you are your best Advocate
08:10 

08:10 right um and sometimes you know the
08:13 

08:13 adversity also comes from yourself um
08:16 

08:16 but you want to make your manager's life
08:18 

08:18 easier by providing upfront you know
08:20 

08:20 this these are the things that I worked
08:21 

08:21 on this week highlight the blockers
08:24 

08:24 highlight what you've solved they like
08:25 

08:25 to know what you solved right um and
08:28 

08:28 then highlight areas where you are
08:29 

08:29 looking for opportunities those are like
08:32 

08:32 top three I feel of things that your
08:34 

08:34 manager needs to know about you I think
08:36 

08:36 when a manager team lead um
08:39 

08:39 relationship is futile is when they are
08:43 

08:43 not clear about what you've been working
08:45 

08:45 on and I've seen that happen many times
08:47 

08:47 like what that person is working on XYZ
08:49 

08:49 I didn't even know that but you're the
08:50 

08:50 manager how do you not know part of it
08:52 

08:52 is them putting in the work to find out
08:55 

08:55 what you're working on they also should
08:56 

08:56 know that but the other part is in order
08:58 

08:58 to make it easier for them them I'm
08:60 

08:60 going to tell them as well and reinforce
09:02 

09:02 right the weekly Cadence works because
09:05 

09:05 it's like you're kind of practicing and
09:08 

09:08 your memory is just through consistency
09:11 

09:11 you you will have a better um memory of
09:14 

09:14 what was discussed personally a
09:16 

09:16 one-on-one dock is something that I find
09:18 

09:18 very important if even more so if your
09:20 

09:20 Cadence is not weekly so I have maybe
09:23 

09:23 monthly by monthly one-on once with my
09:25 

09:25 skip level so those are the times where
09:27 

09:27 I really lean into okay this is the
09:29 

09:29 agenda I want to talk about and I
09:30 

09:30 sometimes send the document beforehand
09:33 

09:33 so she can prep for it too cuz I never
09:35 

09:35 want to catch her off guard and I do
09:37 

09:37 want him or her to have thought about my
09:40 

09:40 questions before responding to me as
09:42 

09:42 well yeah so i' say if it's a direct
09:45 

09:45 relationship like manager or peer weekly
09:47 

09:47 works well personally bi-weekly is a
09:50 

09:50 stretch that's fine um monthly I think I
09:53 

09:53 would Reserve that for like the plus one
09:55 

09:55 kind of um relationship so like skip
09:58 

09:58 level VP if they have time you know kind
10:01 

10:01 of thing to just check in with you or if
10:03 

10:03 you want to you know really check in
10:05 

10:05 with like what is going on with the
10:06 

10:06 entire organization then maybe you have
10:08 

10:08 to schedule some time with them but it
10:10 

10:10 would have to be a more deliberate thing
10:12 

10:12 so I've always heard that uh in in like
10:16 

10:16 workplaces visibility is
10:19 

10:19 everything uh and I've heard like you
10:22 

10:22 know you should like even on LinkedIn
10:24 

10:24 you should post your achievements out
10:26 

10:26 there and you should you know you should
10:28 

10:28 boast about what you have done done even
10:30 

10:30 if it's a failure admit it's a failure
10:32 

10:32 then you know but talk about what you
10:34 

10:34 have learned things like that but
10:36 

10:36 sometimes as an introverted person and a
10:38 

10:38 lot of tech people are quite in
10:41 

10:41 introverted uh or or they maybe just
10:43 

10:43 need a push what do you what tips do you
10:45 

10:45 have for them uh and how important is
10:48 

10:48 this visibility thing or is it too much
10:50 

10:50 to be bragging about yourself sometimes
10:53 

10:53 um to believe it or not I'm also an
10:55 

10:55 introvert like this is this this is
10:57 

10:57 happening but after this I'm going to go
10:59 

10:59 take a nap
10:60 

10:60 um I a fun fact we actually all three of
11:03 

11:03 us are intro inro yes we are they can
11:06 

11:06 tell but yeah I yeah I don't know if you
11:08 

11:08 can tell but we are actually introverts
11:10 

11:10 and after this podcast recording we all
11:12 

11:12 going to be Hermits back in our we're
11:15 

11:15 going to be potatoes yeah yeah um so I
11:19 

11:19 think if you I tend to think of it as
11:22 

11:22 I'm sharing because I want someone else
11:24 

11:24 to know that if it's a sharing of a
11:26 

11:26 failure that it's fine to fail and no
11:29 

11:29 matter what level you are at right um
11:31 

11:31 and to share my learnings from that so
11:33 

11:33 so someone else wouldn't make the same
11:34 

11:34 mistake same thing with stack Overflow
11:36 

11:36 someone's going to post a solution of
11:38 

11:38 something that you have probably come
11:39 

11:39 across and that's probably why you're on
11:40 

11:40 a stack Overflow in the first place or
11:42 

11:42 any other forums is to try to figure out
11:45 

11:45 what's you know what have people tried
11:47 

11:47 um and not to reinvent the wheel as
11:49 

11:49 software Engineers we never want to
11:50 

11:50 reinvent the wheel right and when it
11:52 

11:52 comes to being introvert and like you
11:54 

11:54 know it does feel uncomfortable to do
11:56 

11:56 that right it does feel uncomfortable
11:58 

11:58 and I think um I struggled with that a
12:00 

12:00 lot too about talking about my own
12:02 

12:02 achievements but at the same time I
12:03 

12:03 noticed that if I didn't no like again
12:07 

12:07 you're you're your best Advocate um if
12:10 

12:10 you don't talk about them nobody else is
12:13 

12:13 going to talk about them the way you can
12:16 

12:16 and advocate for yourself the way you
12:18 

12:18 can unless it's like an angel coming and
12:21 

12:21 you know someone who's really blessed in
12:22 

12:22 your life and would die for you kind of
12:25 

12:25 thing it's rare especially in a
12:27 

12:27 workplace right like not everyone's
12:28 

12:28 going to know what you've been working
12:29 

12:29 on they also have to deal with stuff on
12:31 

12:31 their own that that's on their plate um
12:34 

12:34 every time if I do write like a we have
12:36 

12:36 celebration post right and we whenever
12:38 

12:38 we celebrate um the launch of a project
12:41 

12:41 or a retrospective I I try to highlight
12:43 

12:43 like who were involved out not just our
12:46 

12:46 team but outside of our team because
12:47 

12:47 they were instrumental to it as well um
12:49 

12:49 so I think even though it feels
12:52 

12:52 uncomfortable but if I know that one
12:54 

12:54 post if I'm just going to push myself
12:56 

12:56 out the comfort zone not be a potato and
12:59 

12:59 and knowing that that post could reach
13:01 

13:01 and maybe help somebody else and
13:03 

13:03 highlight their achievements I'm going
13:05 

13:05 to do it it's worth it it's worth it to
13:06 

13:06 me um also to highlight the the
13:09 

13:09 so-called failures right because you are
13:11 

13:11 learn like software engineering the
13:13 

13:13 thing about that's so beautiful about it
13:14 

13:14 I love is that it's malleable you can
13:17 

13:17 reverse some changes I mean some things
13:19 

13:19 are maybe less reversible than others
13:21 

13:21 but at the end of the day code is
13:23 

13:23 malleable and you can try to come up a
13:27 

13:27 solution and people are always
13:28 

13:28 interested in knowing how you solve
13:29 

13:29 solve the problem or you know sometimes
13:32 

13:32 they might be facing something that you
13:33 

13:33 know am I the only one having issues is
13:36 

13:36 it am I the only one where it's not
13:38 

13:38 working for maybe somebody else is
13:40 

13:40 starting to report the issue right
13:42 

13:42 Instagram goes down you Instagram is
13:44 

13:44 down where do you look Twitter right or
13:46 

13:46 or X right and and and then you know
13:49 

13:49 that oh okay I I somebody else yeah it's
13:52 

13:52 not just me and that's a nice feeling
13:54 

13:54 that you are going through it with
13:56 

13:56 someone else yeah I definitely uh agree
13:59 

13:59 with on that just because I'm also an
14:01 

14:01 introvert and when I first started my
14:03 

14:03 tech blog like the last thing I want is
14:06 

14:06 like to show it off cuz I really feel
14:08 

14:08 like it's not good enough and why would
14:10 

14:10 anyone want to read this so my primary
14:12 

14:12 motivation for writing my blog in the
14:14 

14:14 first place is to share knowledge a lot
14:17 

14:17 of my readers also emailed me saying
14:19 

14:19 that oh it's because I found your blog
14:20 

14:20 that I was able to solve this issue like
14:22 

14:22 that and that makes me proud because um
14:25 

14:25 if I hadn't you know if let's say like
14:27 

14:27 I'm so secretive and I hide all this
14:30 

14:30 information and I make my blog private
14:32 

14:32 then they they will never solve that
14:33 

14:33 issue so I mean maybe they will from
14:36 

14:36 other sources not mine but but they
14:38 

14:38 found mine and they found it helpful so
14:39 

14:39 that makes me proud yeah so putting it
14:42 

14:42 in the team's environment as well is you
14:44 

14:44 elevating other people so even for me I
14:47 

14:47 would you know praise other Tech blogs I
14:49 

14:49 found a great Tech blog I'll share that
14:51 

14:51 you know and that would actually also
14:52 

14:52 help other people so it's like about
14:54 

14:54 having the community mindset that it's
14:56 

14:56 not just about you it's about the
14:58 

14:58 community that you want to share towards
15:00 

15:00 and so in a way I don't see it as
15:03 

15:03 bragging anymore more like your self
15:06 

15:06 advocating and sharing knowledge yeah
15:09 

15:09 100% agree yeah um so maybe I'll just
15:13 

15:13 segue into a different topic for you
15:15 

15:15 mean so you are now like a very senior
15:18 

15:18 senior software not not senior not that
15:21 

15:21 old okay but like your position is a
15:25 

15:25 staff software engineer so clearly your
15:28 

15:28 career path has been going to a position
15:31 

15:31 where some people would like you know
15:32 

15:32 want to have tips on how how to get
15:34 

15:34 there so maybe some we're looking for
15:36 

15:36 some career tips and advice from you how
15:39 

15:39 do you make yourself stand out we talk
15:41 

15:41 about like having those one-on ones
15:43 

15:43 building relationships with your team
15:45 

15:45 but now when it comes to like self
15:48 

15:48 assessment or like you know n of your
15:50 

15:50 reviews how do you make sure that your
15:52 

15:52 manager recognize you your efforts and
15:54 

15:54 like you know some tips that you can
15:56 

15:56 maybe give on that yeah I think part of
15:60 

15:60 it the the most fundamental step is
16:02 

16:02 acknowledging where you're at and
16:05 

16:05 acknowledging what you're good at and
16:07 

16:07 what your limitations are then from
16:09 

16:09 there you kind of like work it with out
16:11 

16:11 with your manager to see like are there
16:13 

16:13 any opportunities that align where I can
16:14 

16:14 lean into my strengths so back in the
16:17 

16:17 day before my promotion to staff one of
16:19 

16:19 the things that I noticed was you know
16:21 

16:21 we had this um so-called first respond
16:24 

16:24 rotation whereby you for one week at a
16:27 

16:27 time um a member would be in charge of
16:30 

16:30 like support tickets and responding to
16:31 

16:31 those While others focus on like
16:33 

16:33 features and building their products so
16:36 

16:36 the task of the First Responders is
16:37 

16:37 really to triarch right the box that
16:39 

16:39 come in what's most important what's
16:41 

16:41 prior first priority what's not so
16:43 

16:43 important we can probably put in the
16:44 

16:44 backlog um and while our team was
16:47 

16:47 expanding from 8 to now 30 plus the
16:50 

16:50 processes that worked in the past no
16:52 

16:52 longer work for the team of 302 and so I
16:55 

16:55 start to look into oh now we have so
16:58 

16:58 many services that our team is
17:00 

17:00 supposedly in charge of and for our
17:03 

17:03 first responder to have to have
17:05 

17:05 knowledge across all of these Services
17:07 

17:07 was just not sustainable so we had to
17:09 

17:09 split out the rotation into three now
17:11 

17:11 like okay these Services go in here 1/3
17:14 

17:14 1/3 1/3 the rotation also 1/3 1/3 1/3
17:16 

17:16 but now we have different ways of
17:18 

17:18 tracking right so I had to you know
17:20 

17:20 identify the problem um figure out okay
17:24 

17:24 what was the thing that's not working
17:26 

17:26 for us anymore and come out with
17:29 

17:29 solution or proposals at least to um my
17:32 

17:32 manager at that time who was director
17:34 

17:34 and then also talk to my peers like put
17:37 

17:37 out a survey what what's working for you
17:39 

17:39 what's not what is the part about like
17:40 

17:40 first responder that you know is really
17:42 

17:42 painful for you and I try to figure out
17:44 

17:44 okay how do we address the pain points
17:47 

17:47 um when you start to think about pain
17:49 

17:49 points that others are going through
17:52 

17:52 versus like you know yeah I know
17:54 

17:54 understand that we have to ship things
17:55 

17:55 we have to get stuff out of the door but
17:58 

17:58 how can I also make it more enjoyable
17:60 

17:60 for my teammates that's where I think
18:02 

18:02 you can stand out but you have to make
18:04 

18:04 the case for that um and I think you
18:08 

18:08 know when you come to it with a more
18:11 

18:11 holistic picture of your team that's how
18:14 

18:14 you stand out I think the individual
18:17 

18:17 contributor role for sure like you know
18:19 

18:19 when you are first getting into um the
18:22 

18:22 company or the domain of course you need
18:24 

18:24 time to ramp up to get familiar but from
18:27 

18:27 familiarity is where you can see where
18:29 

18:29 the inefficiencies are and that's where
18:31 

18:31 you can leverage those inefficiencies
18:33 

18:33 that you're spotting and bring a
18:36 

18:36 solution or proposal to solve that
18:38 

18:38 problem because no manager likes having
18:41 

18:41 problems thrown at them they like to
18:43 

18:43 hear a problem and hear a solution for
18:45 

18:45 them um so that's where you need to
18:47 

18:47 bring that to the table and that's
18:49 

18:49 something I learned from my dad he's
18:50 

18:50 always like you know you have to think
18:52 

18:52 ahead of your manager they might ask you
18:53 

18:53 for X but you have to give them XYZ or
18:56 

18:56 give them alternatives to consider
18:57 

18:57 because you you know it's easy to just
18:59 

18:59 say okay I solve the problem but what I
19:01 

19:01 want you to do is not just solve the
19:03 

19:03 problem but foresee other problems that
19:05 

19:05 might come up and then have those
19:06 

19:06 solutions for those problems you know
19:08 

19:08 you have to be a step ahead as well and
19:10 

19:10 sometimes we joke about this you're
19:11 

19:11 playing 3D chest almost and it's true in
19:14 

19:14 the real world that that's how you're
19:15 

19:15 going to stand out you're not just
19:16 

19:16 solving the problem that immediately at
19:18 

19:18 hand you're looking forward and you're
19:20 

19:20 taking two steps you know forward for
19:23 

19:23 the team for your manager um yeah and
19:25 

19:25 you know sometimes it is a political
19:27 

19:27 thing that you have to do you have to to
19:29 

19:29 know like by doing this how much Social
19:32 

19:32 Capital am I going to gain you know
19:33 

19:33 politically for my manager for my team
19:35 

19:35 as well um so that's how I would you
19:38 

19:38 know it might sound a little um more
19:42 

19:42 what's that word have like alterior
19:43 

19:43 motive but if the alterior motive also
19:46 

19:46 encompasses elevating the team then it's
19:48 

19:48 worth it's worth the the you know to do
19:51 

19:51 it I would say that's a very valuable
19:53 

19:53 take on that yeah I was wondering maybe
19:56 

19:56 if Salone since you're also like a
19:58 

19:58 senior software engineer if do you have
19:60 

19:60 anything to add on to to that uh no
20:04 

20:04 actually not not on that but I did have
20:06 

20:06 a question like before we like end the
20:09 

20:09 session uh I actually want to know like
20:11 

20:11 do you have tips for feedbacks like uh
20:15 

20:15 at least in our in the teams I've been
20:17 

20:17 in we have a regular habit of giving
20:20 

20:20 feedback to every single other teammate
20:23 

20:23 like peer reviews peer reviews and I
20:26 

20:26 personally have a very hard time to come
20:28 

20:28 up
20:29 

20:29 with uh criticism I think that's the
20:32 

20:32 word constru constructive constructive
20:35 

20:35 feedback for people cuz I don't know if
20:38 

20:38 it's just me I just see the good in
20:39 

20:39 people maybe but it's very hard for me
20:41 

20:41 to like where was this person lacking
20:43 

20:43 what can I think of but and a lot of
20:46 

20:46 times I if even if I come up with
20:48 

20:48 something I feel it's just my opinion
20:50 

20:50 like maybe does that person doesn't need
20:53 

20:53 to change that doesn't need to improve
20:54 

20:54 it I just because I feel it so I find it
20:57 

20:57 really hard to come up with that do you
20:60 

20:60 have any tips for I also have very
21:02 

21:02 difficult especially if you're working
21:03 

21:03 with some of the most brilliant people
21:05 

21:05 you've worked with it's very hard to
21:07 

21:07 find something negative right but
21:09 

21:09 sometimes I do feel like maybe I don't
21:12 

21:12 view it as a negative but hey they're
21:14 

21:14 doing an amazing job how can we further
21:19 

21:19 um maybe they can do more knowledge
21:21 

21:21 sharing with what what's working for
21:23 

21:23 them how did they get to this point and
21:24 

21:24 then that's something that I think is my
21:26 

21:26 most like critical feedback is you know
21:29 

21:29 you're great but how do we replicate
21:31 

21:31 what you're doing and how do you um
21:34 

21:34 ensure maybe you can do it through
21:35 

21:35 mentorship or through guiding other
21:37 

21:37 people and kind of spread that knowledge
21:39 

21:39 right because um you sometimes sometimes
21:42 

21:42 they're really really good but may not
21:44 

21:44 know how to multiply that effect um in a
21:48 

21:48 way that other team members can also
21:50 

21:50 follow like that's something actually I
21:52 

21:52 I have to work on as well is that okay
21:54 

21:54 I'm I'm good at breaking down a really
21:57 

21:57 huge task um into very small chunks that
21:60 

21:60 are organized in certain ways that other
22:02 

22:02 people can like pick off and you know
22:04 

22:04 parallelize and digest it right um but
22:07 

22:07 if you're really struggling then you can
22:08 

22:08 just say in the P feedback like I this
22:09 

22:09 is I'm really stretching it but this is
22:11 

22:11 what I can think of that you can know
22:13 

22:13 further um your impact on or the way you
22:16 

22:16 can feel an impact on now constructive
22:19 

22:19 feedback is also difficult because of
22:21 

22:21 the reason if you do have a CA that's
22:23 

22:23 very difficult to work with then you
22:24 

22:24 never want to Yak their yum but you also
22:27 

22:27 want to know that I need to give this
22:29 

22:29 feedback because it's affecting the team
22:32 

22:32 um so there's this framework called the
22:35 

22:35 non-violent
22:36 

22:36 communication and I have to you know
22:39 

22:39 refresh my memory but I do remember it
22:41 

22:41 being something about like you know
22:42 

22:42 having very specific moments that you
22:45 

22:45 can share with them how those moments
22:47 

22:47 make you feel how you would have liked
22:49 

22:49 it to you know for that person to maybe
22:51 

22:51 do it differently um and you know come
22:54 

22:54 up with a solution with them and I think
22:56 

22:56 you know when you come from it from a
22:58 

22:58 very empathetic point of view and
22:60 

22:60 knowing if they can feel that you're
23:02 

23:02 coming at this with good
23:03 

23:03 intentions and you want to help them
23:06 

23:06 work through it then they will be able
23:08 

23:08 to kind of take that feedback more um in
23:11 

23:11 a in a manner that is is more
23:14 

23:14 productive and sometimes you know you
23:16 

23:16 also have to understand how people like
23:18 

23:18 taking feedback um some people like it
23:20 

23:20 like direct I hate when people beat
23:22 

23:22 around the bush some people needs a
23:24 

23:24 little bit softer lending and you know
23:27 

23:27 we have this thing at work called human
23:29 

23:29 user guides where you can provide like
23:30 

23:30 okay this is how I like to receive
23:31 

23:31 feedback how I like to receive
23:33 

23:33 celebration some people don't like to be
23:34 

23:34 celebrated like publicly they would
23:36 

23:36 rather you tell them in person or
23:38 

23:38 something like or like in a DM um so
23:40 

23:40 human user guides are actually pretty
23:42 

23:42 good I think in if your team is willing
23:44 

23:44 or or wants to do it it's a good way to
23:46 

23:46 just layer like you know expectations
23:49 

23:49 with with people cuz you're working
23:51 

23:51 together right dayto day at the end of
23:53 

23:53 the day you want to cut the tension and
23:56 

23:56 um but it has to be done and I I will
23:58 

23:58 say I've given my fair share of um
24:00 

24:00 constructive feedback and I like I press
24:03 

24:03 submit and I'm like my God please I I
24:04 

24:04 hope they don't do it as anything
24:07 

24:07 personal um it is personal right because
24:09 

24:09 it is a pure feedback but I hope they
24:11 

24:11 view it as something that we can work
24:12 

24:12 together on and sometimes I just follow
24:14 

24:14 up with them in a DM like hey I you know
24:17 

24:17 before I submit this thing I want to
24:18 

24:18 just discuss this with you um and make
24:21 

24:21 sure that you're comfortable with this
24:22 

24:22 and see where I'm coming from and before
24:24 

24:24 you hit the submit button could be a
24:26 

24:26 good thing as well yeah yeah oh yeah
24:29 

24:29 that's something I also uh like try to
24:32 

24:32 do like before before write any
24:34 

24:34 constructive feedback in the proper
24:37 

24:37 documentation I would have a one-on-one
24:38 

24:38 with them let them know in person that
24:41 

24:41 this this is what you I feel you can
24:44 

24:44 improve on if they ask for feedback
24:46 

24:46 usually that's when I tell them so that
24:48 

24:48 they're not surprised by what's going to
24:51 

24:51 come yeah if not they could that could
24:53 

24:53 be taken as a very negative thing oh
24:54 

24:54 wait all this well you were like so
24:55 

24:55 chipper with me and then you're seeing
24:57 

24:57 this so I try to like give them
24:60 

24:60 pre-warning yeah I mean not that I have
25:03 

25:03 very constructed feed BS usually but I
25:06 

25:06 give them like a pre-warning like and I
25:08 

25:08 appreciate if they can do the same with
25:10 

25:10 me as well so that it's not a surprise
25:13 

25:13 like it's like okay go that you told me
25:15 

25:15 actually mid quarter so like by the end
25:17 

25:17 of quarter I'm actually already improved
25:20 

25:20 in that aspect maybe yeah I I think
25:22 

25:22 that's a very key thing to bring up
25:24 

25:24 because when I do see something that you
25:26 

25:26 know you have to nip it in a BT like
25:28 

25:28 when it's happening and you feel
25:29 

25:29 uncomfortable with that situation you
25:31 

25:31 you just have to tell them there and
25:32 

25:32 then you know and it's sometimes I I
25:34 

25:34 give it another time before I tell them
25:36 

25:36 because maybe they just did the first
25:38 

25:38 time was by mistake but if the second
25:39 

25:39 time they're doing it then and it's
25:41 

25:41 consistent then I will I will tell them
25:43 

25:43 in a DM like you know hey I noce XYZ and
25:46 

25:46 it really make me feel this way and I
25:49 

25:49 think that we could probably come up
25:51 

25:51 like do you think you can help me come
25:53 

25:53 of a way to Le it better maybe or
25:56 

25:56 something like that and times when I
25:58 

25:58 done that it was um productive because
26:01 

26:01 they didn't even realize what they were
26:03 

26:03 you know what they were doing was making
26:04 

26:04 someone feel uncomfortable and they were
26:06 

26:06 actually thankful that someone
26:07 

26:07 highlighted it to them and I think
26:10 

26:10 nobody's perfect we are all on a
26:12 

26:12 Learning Journey there something that I
26:14 

26:14 do I'm sure people I have issues with or
26:16 

26:16 something and if they give me feedback
26:18 

26:18 like hey you know um do you think I do
26:20 

26:20 it this way instead I'm going to take
26:21 

26:21 that feedback and I'm going to improve
26:23 

26:23 because I want to be a person that
26:25 

26:25 people want to work with and I want to
26:27 

26:27 make sure that our team doesn't have any
26:29 

26:29 tension that it's you want you want all
26:32 

26:32 of that to be established so that you
26:33 

26:33 can focus on the actual business logic
26:35 

26:35 or the actual problems that are coming
26:37 

26:37 up right but I I will say this again and
26:40 

26:40 again the most difficult problems to
26:42 

26:42 solve are the the ones involving humans
26:44 

26:44 any software problem always boils down
26:46 

26:46 to a human problem I feel yeah it's true
26:49 

26:49 definitely I think a hug is more you
26:52 

26:52 know specific deliberate and would be
26:54 

26:54 more clear so that's something that
26:56 

26:56 maybe people who watch this episode can
26:59 

26:59 suggest to their you know their team
27:01 

27:01 like to do right maybe we'll even link a
