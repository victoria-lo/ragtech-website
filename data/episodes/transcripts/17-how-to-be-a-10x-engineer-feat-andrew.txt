00:00 hello everyone welcome to re Tech I'm
00:03 

00:03 Salon a software developer I'm Victoria
00:06 

00:06 Solutions engineer and today's episode
00:08 

00:08 is going to be on how to be a 10x
00:10 

00:10 software engineer and with that our
00:12 

00:12 guest speaker for today is Andrew a
00:14 

00:14 senior software engineer Andrew hi
00:17 

00:17 everyone I'm Andrew I'm a senior
00:19 

00:19 software engineer at a fintech company
00:22 

00:22 and uh with that today we would like to
00:26 

00:26 Dive Right In and you know how AI has
00:28 

00:28 been such a uh good
00:31 

00:31 significant part of most software
00:32 

00:32 developers life already like with
00:34 

00:34 co-pilot do you think in like the next 5
00:37 

00:37 to 10 years will there even be like
00:39 

00:39 software developing jobs I think there
00:43 

00:43 will still be like 5 to 10 years is
00:45 

00:45 quite a a short time period right and
00:48 

00:48 there still need to be developers
00:50 

00:50 developing those softwares obviously
00:52 

00:52 it's in a more specific field like AI or
00:55 

00:55 like LM or like whatever is trending
00:58 

00:58 right now these tools are not I feel
00:59 

00:59 like these two are still quite in their
01:01 

01:01 early infancy stages and I don't think
01:05 

01:05 we are probably at a stage whereby we
01:07 

01:07 can fully commit to them completely let
01:10 

01:10 replacing whatever we Cote right it's
01:12 

01:12 it's it's not something that at least
01:14 

01:14 for me personally I I don't think I can
01:16 

01:16 SK like my 100% and just take take
01:19 

01:19 whatever that's produced from there and
01:20 

01:20 just like com it and deploy it there
01:23 

01:23 still needs to be some like eyeballing
01:25 

01:25 or even like refactoring it's not
01:27 

01:27 something that you can just take and r
01:29 

01:29 fit into specific use cases you still
01:30 

01:30 have to to take a look at what's your
01:32 

01:32 use case and the way it's being
01:34 

01:34 implemented and how does it fit into the
01:36 

01:36 the design of the system yeah yeah I
01:39 

01:39 think I definitely agree with that cuz
01:41 

01:41 uh even though AI is something that's
01:43 

01:43 continuously improving and Rising there
01:46 

01:46 still needs to be human intervention
01:48 

01:48 right like there still needs to be a
01:50 

01:50 human behind to
01:51 

01:51 Monitor and all that yeah so definitely
01:54 

01:54 agree with that uh I was curious about
01:56 

01:56 salon's take on on this yeah actually
01:60 

01:60 similar I don't think I do think that
02:03 

02:03 software Engineers would be lower in
02:05 

02:05 demand but they'll still be there a year
02:08 

02:08 ago we had like an influx of software
02:10 

02:10 engines I don't think we need that
02:11 

02:11 anymore like we don't need this High
02:13 

02:13 Supply anymore most of the time I think
02:15 

02:15 what's going to Happ I how I Envision it
02:17 

02:17 would be like PMS product managers would
02:18 

02:18 just be prompting uh the the AI that
02:22 

02:22 build me a website that can sell this
02:25 

02:25 product with a shopping cart so it will
02:27 

02:27 be able to do that but then the problem
02:29 

02:29 comes in when you want customize a like
02:31 

02:31 but then I also wanted to do this and
02:33 

02:33 that then I don't think it'll be it will
02:36 

02:36 be able to do customizations as such on
02:39 

02:39 top of existing code and things like
02:41 

02:41 that so for that you will still need one
02:44 

02:44 or two software developers on the team
02:46 

02:46 who will help to no this nuances here
02:48 

02:48 and there and maintain uh do some custom
02:52 

02:52 stuff but so but I do and I don't see
02:55 

02:55 that not as many software developers
02:58 

02:58 required yeah and to that I can also add
03:00 

03:00 on is because they will probably
03:02 

03:02 revolutionize the way software
03:04 

03:04 engineering is taught it'll probably be
03:06 

03:06 more solutions focused like
03:09 

03:09 understanding how to solve problems
03:11 

03:11 rather than like focusing on you know
03:13 

03:13 writing the code
03:14 

03:14 accurately because now we have all these
03:16 

03:16 AI tools to help us write the code so
03:19 

03:19 now people have to think beyond that
03:21 

03:21 beyond the code and focus more on how to
03:23 

03:23 solve problems how to engineer Solutions
03:26 

03:26 yeah and I think it will now help for
03:28 

03:28 software engers to be more
03:30 

03:30 expressive about their thoughts so that
03:34 

03:34 you can prompt yeah so like that's why
03:37 

03:37 prompt engineering is also a new skill
03:39 

03:39 that everyone is trying to do yeah so
03:42 

03:42 with that I would like to segue into a
03:43 

03:43 similar topic let's say I am a fresh
03:45 

03:45 grad you know just out of computer
03:47 

03:47 science you know I'm a computer science
03:48 

03:48 major or I'm like in first year just got
03:51 

03:51 in what kind of advice do you have for
03:53 

03:53 these newcomers like in the tech
03:55 

03:55 industry to prepare to become aspiring
03:58 

03:58 software Engineers with the of AI I
04:01 

04:01 think first thing is have an open
04:04 

04:04 mind and just don't be too quick to
04:09 

04:09 dismiss the fact that you may may not be
04:12 

04:12 interested in a or you think that
04:14 

04:14 it's not relevant or it's a gim or magic
04:17 

04:17 thing right I think just be openminded
04:19 

04:19 about it because you never know you
04:21 

04:21 might be interested in a specific subset
04:25 

04:25 of it because I mean AI is quite a buzz
04:27 

04:27 well it's quite a broad term there's so
04:29 

04:29 many different different components of
04:31 

04:31 it so just keep an open mind and talk to
04:34 

04:34 your peers talk to your seniors in
04:37 

04:37 University or even attend those career
04:40 

04:40 Affairs whereby they have uh talks or
04:44 

04:44 even like Fireside panels with like uh
04:47 

04:47 existing employees of those companies
04:49 

04:49 then you can get a sense of like what
04:51 

04:51 are the challenges in those in the
04:54 

04:54 industry right now because I think more
04:55 

04:55 often than not like in University it's
04:58 

04:58 you're pretty much in a like Docker
05:00 

05:00 containers it's like everything is
05:02 

05:02 self-contained everything is working out
05:05 

05:05 perfectly for you because there's a
05:06 

05:06 curriculum and stuff but like the real
05:09 

05:09 experience is kind of out there like
05:11 

05:11 doing your internships and when you
05:13 

05:13 actually get to work so looking into
05:15 

05:15 those seeking out those opportunities uh
05:17 

05:17 is would be good for aspiring software
05:20 

05:20 engineer and another thing is like not
05:22 

05:22 related to AI but like try to not keep
05:27 

05:27 yourself constrained to the curriculum
05:29 

05:29 and school because that is something
05:32 

05:32 that uh professors or like uh teaching
05:37 

05:37 assistants they came out with that
05:38 

05:38 because that's they felt that that is
05:40 

05:40 the easiest way for you to pick up that
05:42 

05:42 specific lecture but actually that you
05:45 

05:45 can just like feel free to Google right
05:46 

05:46 I mean like nowadays go is I mean not
05:49 

05:49 now but it's always free so you can just
05:51 

05:51 go go there and like and like I me
05:53 

05:53 there's nothing wrong with like going to
05:55 

05:55 I think there there like a stigma of
05:56 

05:56 like people thinking that oh you can
05:59 

05:59 like copy code from stack Overflow but I
06:02 

06:02 think it's it's okay as long as you have
06:04 

06:04 learned something from it it's not okay
06:05 

06:05 if you just copy and paste it and then
06:08 

06:08 submit your your assignment right yeah
06:10 

06:10 so I think this keep on discovering as
06:12 

06:12 you uh progress through your uni because
06:15 

06:15 I I don't think at least for me I I
06:18 

06:18 wasn't really sure what what feel I'm
06:20 

06:20 interested in uh after I graduated and
06:23 

06:23 in fact think most of my peers actually
06:25 

06:25 didn't end up being software Engineers
06:27 

06:27 cuz they realize through the C of your
06:31 

06:31 study in school they didn't like they
06:33 

06:33 didn't like coding
06:34 

06:34 yeah different different fields like
06:38 

06:38 data science there's uiux there's uh
06:41 

06:41 being a product
06:43 

06:43 manager AI you know like there's so many
06:46 

06:46 different fields so yeah you have to you
06:48 

06:48 have to be able to understand which one
06:50 

06:50 are you leaning towards I think the
06:52 

06:52 important thing is that it's okay to not
06:55 

06:55 know what you like but it's good to
06:60 

06:60 continue to know what you don't like for
07:03 

07:03 me I did a second major in analytics oh
07:06 

07:06 and I I would say absolutely hated it
07:09 

07:09 but I knew that it was not my cup of tea
07:11 

07:11 because it wasn't as like satisfying to
07:15 

07:15 see cuz everything was like more numbers
07:18 

07:18 in the background that's very insightful
07:20 

07:20 because I think a lot of people when
07:22 

07:22 they just come into University they
07:24 

07:24 think they know exactly what they want
07:26 

07:26 and then maybe after a few courses later
07:30 

07:30 they realize it's not their cup of tea
07:32 

07:32 and that's okay yeah um but since you
07:34 

07:34 are a senior software engineer in your
07:37 

07:37 experience so far what do you think are
07:39 

07:39 the essential skills that you need in
07:41 

07:41 order to succeed in a software engineer
07:42 

07:42 role for me personally the first thing
07:45 

07:45 is definitely to be
07:49 

07:49 proactive about the way you do things so
07:52 

07:52 when I say proactive it's like don't
07:54 

07:54 just like do like tickets after tickets
07:57 

07:57 like J tickets after like task after Tas
07:60 

07:60 like blindly like try to understand like
08:04 

08:04 why are we doing this uh certain
08:06 

08:06 features and like how can it be changed
08:09 

08:09 like why why are we even prioritizing
08:11 

08:11 this try to kind of
08:13 

08:13 challenge uh challenge your own like
08:16 

08:16 thinking and like think how could we
08:19 

08:19 have done it differently at least for me
08:23 

08:23 I'm looking at the fintech which is a
08:25 

08:25 product company priority is always to
08:27 

08:27 kind of ship out features right and then
08:30 

08:30 like you you never have the time to
08:32 

08:32 really think about what is the most
08:34 

08:34 scalable way and most ideal way to kind
08:37 

08:37 of cod out feature so you always go with
08:39 

08:39 like the most hacky and like the easiest
08:43 

08:43 way the least time that you need to to
08:45 

08:45 ship a feature second important skill I
08:47 

08:47 think is that your your communication
08:51 

08:51 skills have to be
08:53 

08:53 constantly improved and not just succumb
08:56 

08:56 to the fact that uh succumb to the
08:58 

08:58 common generalization that software
09:00 

09:00 Engineers are like introverts and and
09:03 

09:03 they can code but then their
09:04 

09:04 presentation skill skills are lousy and
09:06 

09:06 like they can't communicate with other
09:08 

09:08 teams they just receive the requirements
09:10 

09:10 they code it out and then they never
09:12 

09:12 interact with any other team but that's
09:14 

09:14 that's obviously not true right because
09:17 

09:17 at I mean today's world you have to work
09:20 

09:20 with other teams be non-technical teams
09:23 

09:23 like operations like product managers
09:25 

09:25 there is that cross team collaboration
09:27 

09:27 and if your communication skills is not
09:30 

09:30 good then like people won't be a to
09:33 

09:33 understand what you're where you're
09:34 

09:34 coming from especially if there's a
09:37 

09:37 clash of ideas right you need to kind of
09:39 

09:39 put your idea forth in a in a suing
09:43 

09:43 manner but that being said um I don't
09:47 

09:47 think everyone at least for me my
09:49 

09:49 personally as well I don't think that
09:50 

09:50 everyone starts off with like speaking
09:53 

09:53 the best and like communicating best so
09:55 

09:55 it's it's a constant Improvement that
09:57 

09:57 you have to kind of evaluate make seek
10:00 

10:00 out opportunities that uh will allow you
10:03 

10:03 to kind of improve the way you
10:05 

10:05 communicate which is one of the reasons
10:06 

10:06 why I decided to to be in this podcast
10:09 

10:09 as well because it's something I've
10:10 

10:10 never done before and like I think it's
10:12 

10:12 quite different to have like like
10:14 

10:14 cameras witing at you verus
10:17 

10:17 like cameras what you talking about no
10:21 

10:21 one here it's just three of us talking
10:23 

10:23 but yeah so it's a
10:25 

10:25 interesting type of communication style
10:28 

10:28 that you have to adjust to as well so
10:31 

10:31 and the last thing is be more conscious
10:33 

10:33 of the things that you like to do at
10:36 

10:36 work and the things that you don't like
10:38 

10:38 to because I think everyone has that
10:41 

10:41 like list especially when you are done
10:44 

10:44 with a certain task and then you you
10:46 

10:46 move on to the next task right and then
10:48 

10:48 like you realize next task is something
10:50 

10:50 that you kind of dread because you have
10:52 

10:52 done it before and it's a bit more
10:54 

10:54 manual like it's not as you don't have
10:57 

10:57 much learning from it I think you just
10:59 

10:59 need to be more conscious of it and for
11:02 

11:02 the stuff that you like to do uh do more
11:04 

11:04 of it it's
11:07 

11:07 like less likely that you go down the
11:10 

11:10 road of burning out eventually cuz imag
11:12 

11:12 you keep doing things that you don't
11:13 

11:13 like it's just like you keep eventually
11:15 

11:15 you dread waking up opening the laptop
11:18 

11:18 to do those stuff I really like a lot of
11:19 

11:19 the points that you mentioned especially
11:21 

11:21 the part when you mentioned um do stuff
11:23 

11:23 more that you like and try to do less of
11:26 

11:26 that you don't like so at least for me I
11:29 

11:29 relate to that because I usually keep
11:30 

11:30 like an energy portfolio where like one
11:33 

11:33 is stuff that energizes me one is stuff
11:35 

11:35 that drains me so I try to do like let's
11:38 

11:38 say I did one hour of stuff that drains
11:40 

11:40 me I have to immediately counter that
11:43 

11:43 with something that I like so it's like
11:45 

11:45 you can alternate and then you can find
11:47 

11:47 out what is the golden ratio also for
11:49 

11:49 the stuff that you like to do and the
11:51 

11:51 stuff you don't really like to do so
11:52 

11:52 that way your energy portfolio is like
11:55 

11:55 balanced then throughout the day you
11:56 

11:56 don't feel so drained yeah that that's
11:59 

11:59 just something I personally do at work
12:03 

12:03 um that's really interesting really
12:06 

12:06 first time I heard the term energy
12:09 

12:09 portfol it's called Energy Management I
12:11 

12:11 actually read a book on that I forgot
12:14 

12:14 the title but it's no longer about time
12:16 

12:16 management because you can manage the
12:18 

12:18 time however you want it's so easy to
12:20 

12:20 block your calendars but let's say every
12:22 

12:22 single thing that you block in your
12:23 

12:23 calendar is all energy draining
12:26 

12:26 activities what is the point of time
12:28 

12:28 management you can be as efficient as
12:29 

12:29 you want but you won't be happy and then
12:32 

12:32 long term you'll be burnt out so that's
12:34 

12:34 why these days uh at least for me
12:37 

12:37 personally I focus more on Energy
12:38 

12:38 Management rather than time management
12:40 

12:40 cuz that way you're using your own time
12:44 

12:44 naturally more effectively and your own
12:46 

12:46 mental energy and everything yeah yeah
12:49 

12:49 I'm like getting like be very
12:50 

12:50 intentional like even from what you are
12:52 

12:52 suggesting intentional in what what task
12:55 

12:55 you're doing what uh things you're
12:57 

12:57 learning and everything yeah I think
12:59 

12:59 definitely will take time like
13:00 

13:00 especially if you just coming into new
13:02 

13:02 company or like if you're fresh gr
13:04 

13:04 you're still like figuring things out
13:06 

13:06 but that's okay so just let yourself
13:07 

13:07 take time to figure it out and then make
13:10 

13:10 a list I think many people they like to
13:13 

13:13 keep a lot of things in their head and
13:14 

13:14 then they don't write it down but by
13:16 

13:16 writing it down you become more aware in
13:18 

13:18 a way right like these are the things I
13:20 

13:20 like these are the things I don't like
13:22 

13:22 as much and then they will help you keep
13:24 

13:24 track over your the course of your
13:26 

13:26 career at least yeah and it could be
13:28 

13:28 different from it could be writing it or
13:30 

13:30 present present about things about like
13:33 

13:33 things you have learned at your company
13:35 

13:35 or at Community talks and things like
13:37 

13:37 that yeah definitely yeah I actually
13:39 

13:39 wanted to uh dive into like actually how
13:41 

13:41 did you become a software
13:44 

13:44 developer right where you always it was
13:46 

13:46 it in your mind that I'm going to be
13:48 

13:48 your soft yeah def definitely not
13:51 

13:51 something that I had in mind when I was
13:54 

13:54 kind of like progressing through
13:57 

13:57 Singapore's education because I think
13:60 

13:60 uh Singapore education is
14:02 

14:02 quite um rigid in the sense that
14:05 

14:05 everyone starts off with the same kind
14:07 

14:07 of mindset just get through Primary
14:09 

14:09 School secondary school and I think the
14:11 

14:11 first decision point is probably after
14:13 

14:13 all levels when you have to choose
14:14 

14:14 between junior college and uh poly right
14:19 

14:19 and then at a point in time I OB
14:22 

14:22 obviously didn't know what I wanted to
14:23 

14:23 do so that kind of eliminates Paulie
14:26 

14:26 because like I I literally don't know I
14:29 

14:29 I felt that it was a risk if I just
14:31 

14:31 randomly chose one m so it's when to JC
14:34 

14:34 and even when JC is just kind of every
14:36 

14:36 has the same mindset sketchu two years
14:38 

14:38 of JC I I feel like doesn't really
14:40 

14:40 matter which subjects you chose at a
14:42 

14:42 point in time it's just cuz I mean if
14:45 

14:45 you ask me I don't remember any of those
14:47 

14:47 or it's not really relevant to what I'm
14:49 

14:49 doing um and I think it's only at the
14:52 

14:52 point of entering University like right
14:56 

14:56 after my Army I kind of gave serious
14:59 

14:59 taught to it and I was looking through
15:02 

15:02 like all the degrees that were offered
15:04 

15:04 in by the various universities and I
15:07 

15:07 just thought that Computing or like
15:09 

15:09 software back then I wouldn't I didn't
15:12 

15:12 really even grasp the term software
15:15 

15:15 engineering I just thought that all it's
15:17 

15:17 Computer Engineering in n and it's like
15:19 

15:19 information systems and SMU and end up
15:22 

15:22 choosing Information Systems I think it
15:24 

15:24 was once I started writing like my first
15:27 

15:27 B lines of code and it just kind of like
15:31 

15:31 sparked something in me because I just
15:35 

15:35 felt that it's something that I can do
15:39 

15:39 independently can produce like I mean
15:42 

15:42 back then was just like like printing
15:43 

15:43 some statements like putting like a
15:45 

15:45 Christmas tree like in the in the
15:48 

15:48 command promt right I just I just
15:50 

15:50 thought it was uh kind of magical going
15:53 

15:53 to say hello world I'm
15:55 

15:55 like okay like his first a christmase
15:58 

15:58 exciting yes is not a Christmas some
16:01 

16:01 pattern of sort that you obviously
16:04 

16:04 wouldn't just hard like use like a four
16:07 

16:07 Loop or like like just print it out I
16:09 

16:09 just thought exx yeah with the yeah I
16:13 

16:13 just thought it was like it was like
16:15 

16:15 really magical to me that that that can
16:18 

16:18 be done by someone that have like no
16:22 

16:22 experience I mean prior to joining uh
16:24 

16:24 University M so I think that kind of
16:26 

16:26 spouted something of in me and then I
16:30 

16:30 eventually graduated to be honest I was
16:32 

16:32 still at a loss of like what industry
16:35 

16:35 should I join cuz it's like I think
16:38 

16:38 University can only prepare you like
16:40 

16:40 school can only prepare you so much to a
16:42 

16:42 certain extent like you still have to
16:44 

16:44 make the decision by your service you
16:45 

16:45 had to be informed so I ended up joining
16:49 

16:49 a consulting company but yeah long story
16:53 

16:53 short I think it's through like my first
16:56 

16:56 job and like internships that I kind of
16:58 

16:58 like realized I like it I like software
17:01 

17:01 enging more and more if I would stayed
17:03 

17:03 there for long I would progress more
17:06 

17:06 towards being a consultant so it's more
17:08 

17:08 like people facing which I didn't want
17:12 

17:12 cuz I knew I still wanted a code that's
17:14 

17:14 why I decided to join uh Product Company
17:18 

17:18 which I felt kind of Embraces like
17:21 

17:21 software engering more yeah that's
17:24 

17:24 really nice it's like basically you
17:25 

17:25 found what you like and then you
17:27 

17:27 immediately know that
17:30 

17:30 it's not for you you really like coding
17:33 

17:33 it just have that spark right so just
17:36 

17:36 knowing that from the beginning I think
17:37 

17:37 that's very good I I would say maybe not
17:40 

17:40 a lot of people might Discover it from
17:42 

17:42 their first job they might think oh it's
17:43 

17:43 already so stable and I already like
17:46 

17:46 know in the ins and outs of my first job
17:48 

17:48 then they'll just stay there uh they get
17:49 

17:49 comfortable fast sometimes yeah so it's
17:52 

17:52 good that you can identify that and you
17:54 

17:54 know focus on what you really love I
17:56 

17:56 think it's always has been Andrew's
17:58 

17:58 philosophy is like you know focus on
18:00 

18:00 what you like to do and then find it
18:03 

18:03 find it first and then focus on and then
18:05 

18:05 even within the job like see what you
18:07 

18:07 like in software development yeah so
18:09 

18:09 it's just narrowing what you like like
18:11 

18:11 like you know and that makes a happier
18:13 

18:13 life is that
18:15 

18:15 your it could be uh yeah but now I
18:19 

18:19 mention I think like kind of fun
18:21 

18:21 funneling down to what you really want
18:24 

18:24 to do cuz I think I mean don't want to
18:26 

18:26 sound cliche but like life is only you
18:29 

18:29 have this amount of years to live in
18:31 

18:31 your life and
18:32 

18:32 obviously career is just one part of it
18:35 

18:35 and I also wanted to ask uh actually
18:38 

18:38 what are what is a what is your take on
18:40 

18:40 like mentoring like colleagues at work
18:43 

18:43 as a senior software engineer do you
18:45 

18:45 intentionally do that and how do you
18:49 

18:49 approach uh you know helping someone
18:51 

18:51 else along uh in your career I want say
18:54 

18:54 it's intentional it just happens along
18:56 

18:56 the way as you kind of progress or as
18:59 

18:59 you get more senior obviously there will
19:01 

19:01 be new joiners joining your team there
19:03 

19:03 might be people coming off University
19:06 

19:06 that really have not much course to zero
19:09 

19:09 experience in whatever domain they
19:12 

19:12 you're working on so I think it happens
19:14 

19:14 naturally because that being said it
19:18 

19:18 it's kind of like a natural progression
19:21 

19:21 that I mean if you are more senior then
19:23 

19:23 kind of make sense that you have
19:24 

19:24 allocated or you allocate some of your
19:27 

19:27 time to help people that more Junior
19:30 

19:30 maybe building rep of your team as well
19:33 

19:33 so yeah in terms of yeah in terms of
19:35 

19:35 mentoring I think there's there's
19:39 

19:39 no there's no right or wrong way of
19:41 

19:41 doing it you just do however that comes
19:44 

19:44 to your mind that you think it's
19:45 

19:45 appropriate I think it it kind of as
19:48 

19:48 long as it makes sense to you uh I would
19:50 

19:50 say just just do it
19:52 

19:52 and I think the important thing is to
19:54 

19:54 get feedback from the person you're
19:55 

19:55 mentoring and not just kind of vomit
19:58 

19:58 everything out on that person so I think
20:01 

20:01 it still has to be a
20:02 

20:02 two-way communication between you and
20:05 

20:05 the person they trying to Mentor the
20:07 

20:07 thing that I personally struggle with
20:10 

20:10 sometimes as well just to be completely
20:11 

20:11 honest is where you draw the line
20:13 

20:13 between like being too overly helpful
20:16 

20:16 like when I say that in the extreme case
20:18 

20:18 would be like basic like spoon feeding
20:20 

20:20 like the the solution like the direction
20:23 

20:23 you go to versus letting them discover
20:27 

20:27 the solution on their own doing some
20:29 

20:29 self-discovery I think that that line is
20:31 

20:31 quite hard to draw sometimes because as
20:33 

20:33 much as possible you like for that
20:37 

20:37 engineer that Junior engineer to
20:39 

20:39 complete the task in a timely way
20:43 

20:43 knowing that if you don't help them to
20:45 

20:45 like 80% of the way then maybe they
20:47 

20:47 might overrun the time I think as much
20:50 

20:50 as possible I would say not to
20:53 

20:53 completely spon feed them like at least
20:54 

20:54 give them maybe like 30% or like 40% of
20:58 

20:58 the the solution to I mean the intended
21:01 

21:01 solution to kind of think for themselves
21:04 

21:04 and even even stuff like where do you
21:06 

21:06 find um certain resources I mean sure
21:09 

21:09 you can pass with them but there's a lot
21:11 

21:11 of things that you can actually
21:12 

21:12 self-discover by yourself and through
21:13 

21:13 that self-discovery you kind
21:15 

21:15 of kind of think to yourself like what
21:19 

21:19 are all these uh concept and maybe you
21:22 

21:22 can Google yourself I think that's
21:23 

21:23 that's also a good form of like
21:25 

21:25 self-discovery and self- learning and it
21:27 

21:27 kind of benefits them better versus like
21:30 

21:30 you teaching them but that being said I
21:33 

21:33 think everyone has their own learning
21:35 

21:35 style some like to be Mentor in that way
21:39 

21:39 or sound like just like to be pointed in
21:41 

21:41 the right direction and then schol stop
21:42 

21:42 and then I'll just check back with you
21:44 

21:44 like maybe two weeks later I actually
21:46 

21:46 really like uh the way you think about
21:48 

21:48 mentorship is and that you're aware that
21:51 

21:51 people have different ways of taking in
21:54 

21:54 information learning so you're aware of
21:56 

21:56 it so you try to cater to that and also
21:59 

21:59 that you appreciate that teaching is the
22:02 

22:02 best way to learn so imparting knowledge
22:05 

22:05 yeah I always say that imparting
22:07 

22:07 knowledge will also make you learn and
22:09 

22:09 also help the other person out uh uh
22:13 

22:13 just want like just curious in your
22:15 

22:15 journey did you have a me a mentor or
22:18 

22:18 like a role model or someone that you
22:20 

22:20 were looking up to or someone that was
22:22 

22:22 actually mentoring you even I definitely
22:26 

22:26 had one but I think was more at my my
22:28 

22:28 first job he was someone that I looked
22:31 

22:31 up to
22:33 

22:33 because of the perception that IE of him
22:38 

22:38 like he would always be able to lead
22:40 

22:40 certain projects in a really smart way
22:43 

22:43 and like a really efficient way level
22:45 

22:45 headedness is something that I felt that
22:48 

22:48 I aspired to have and also the way he
22:52 

22:52 was really helpful to other uh like in
22:55 

22:55 general everyone that was in the project
22:58 

22:58 so he did really like specifically have
23:00 

23:00 any form of bias or like specifically
23:02 

23:02 help specific people and so years later
23:06 

23:06 do you think you're closer to that goal
23:08 

23:08 or I think I am closer but not it's hard
23:13 

23:13 to put a percentage on it still still
23:15 

23:15 work in progress definitely yeah I've
23:17 

23:17 actually I've worked with Andrew before
23:19 

23:19 and I I do see some similarities in your
23:22 

23:22 role model and yourself actually like I
23:25 

23:25 can understand uh what what so you find
23:28 

23:28 those characterist like familiar
23:30 

23:30 familiar like I'm like oh that's where
23:31 

23:31 he's coming from that's that's how he's
23:33 

23:33 like that and based on salon's feedback
23:36 

23:36 looks like you're on your way you're on
23:38 

23:38 your way your be very proud and I guess
23:42 

23:42 that's that would be a wrap on our
23:44 

23:44 episode on how to be a 10x engineer we
23:46 

23:46 learned so many things like uh you know
23:49 

23:49 being proactive communication is
23:52 

23:52 required as as an engineer and of course
23:55 

23:55 you know having like figuring out what
23:57 

23:57 do you like to be be happier with your
23:60 

23:60 workplace and in life in general and of
24:03 

24:03 course having a role model does help
24:05 

24:05 being mentored having a mentor uh things
24:08 

24:08 like that just being aware and aware of
24:11 

24:11 like learning styles and things like
24:12 

24:12 that also I like to point out like you
24:14 

24:14 know how in most social media being 10x
24:17 

24:17 engineer is always about like the heart
24:19 

24:19 skills like practice those problems or
24:21 

24:21 like being good at those keyboard
24:22 

24:22 shortcuts I really like how throughout
24:25 

24:25 this whole episode when he was sharing
24:27 

24:27 his experience and advice we he focused
24:30 

24:30 a lot on the soft skills right and I
24:32 

24:32 think that is worth way more than just
24:34 

24:34 practicing hard skills we're not saying
24:36 

24:36 like hard skills is nothing but even if
24:38 

24:38 you had those hard skills down you still
24:41 

24:41 cannot forget all these things that
24:42 

24:42 Andrew mentioned so I think
24:44 

24:44 fundamentally being a 10x engineer is
24:47 

24:47 also about excelling at communication
24:50 

24:50 you know understanding people and just
24:53 

24:53 being curious about yourself and about
24:55 

24:55 others in general So yeah thank you so
24:58 

24:58 much Andrew I think it was a very
24:59 

24:59 insightful episode and we thank you for
