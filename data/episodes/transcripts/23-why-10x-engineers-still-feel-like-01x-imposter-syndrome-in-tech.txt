00:00 about like everything is interconnected
00:02 

00:02 right you think like you're you're just
00:04 

00:04 starting out learning how to build like
00:06 

00:06 a not GS app and before you know it
00:08 

00:08 you're looking into cicd and before you
00:11 

00:11 know it you're looking into cloud
00:13 

00:13 computing as well and you're like it
00:16 

00:16 have that I like sometimes when I face
00:18 

00:18 imposter syndrome or just low confidence
00:21 

00:21 in in some sense I'll always think to
00:24 

00:24 myself that oh but I'm not director of
00:26 

00:26 women deps I'm representing women devs
00:30 

00:30 down while like I have no doubts that
00:32 

00:32 sonone would somehow like just rise it
00:34 

00:34 back up like I was just waiting for that
00:36 

00:36 message until say we're back you know
00:40 

00:40 [Music]
00:43 

00:43 like welcome everyone to R te where we
00:46 

00:46 engage in bites and banter I'm Salon a
00:49 

00:49 software developer I'm Natasha a
00:51 

00:51 software engineer and I'm Victoria a
00:53 

00:53 Solutions engineer and today's episode
00:55 

00:55 is going to be about imposter syndrome
00:57 

00:57 imposter syndrome is something a lot of
00:59 

00:59 tech people people actually face and
01:02 

01:02 experience in today's episode we'll be
01:04 

01:04 talking about our personal stories and
01:06 

01:06 how we deal with it in our life as well
01:09 

01:09 as work my recent experience U mentoring
01:13 

01:13 uh somebody else who was more Junior
01:15 

01:15 than I was uh it was part of a
01:17 

01:17 mentorship program and she brought up
01:19 

01:19 like that she was experiencing that in
01:22 

01:22 her first ever Endeavor in the workplace
01:25 

01:25 it really brought back memories of me
01:27 

01:27 back when I first ventured into Tech and
01:29 

01:29 I started of feeling like I was way more
01:32 

01:32 stupid than everybody else and I think
01:34 

01:34 it's very natural in this industry to
01:37 

01:37 feel that way because it's so technical
01:40 

01:40 right like everything seems to rest on
01:41 

01:41 your technical competence from the day
01:43 

01:43 you start University right from the day
01:46 

01:46 you if if you do take a computer science
01:48 

01:48 or related software engineering course
01:50 

01:50 and the moment you step out then it's
01:52 

01:52 lead coding it's a technical interviews
01:54 

01:54 like everything just seems so based on
01:57 

01:57 your technical Merit that you often
02:00 

02:00 don't know where the end is like at what
02:03 

02:03 point I consider myself a specialist an
02:05 

02:05 expert for her she was still in uh
02:08 

02:08 University she just started like sort of
02:10 

02:10 like her first internship I think when
02:12 

02:12 she brought this up it was in the
02:14 

02:14 context of she was experiencing a
02:17 

02:17 workplace situation but she didn't dare
02:20 

02:20 to speak up and this not wanting to
02:23 

02:23 speak up really stemmed from like oh
02:25 

02:25 that self-doubt you know that comes from
02:27 

02:27 feeling like an imposter in this case
02:30 

02:30 and how does imposter syndrome really
02:31 

02:31 feel like it's the root of it is
02:33 

02:33 self-doubt feeling like you're not good
02:36 

02:36 enough that you're faking it all the
02:38 

02:38 time um even though you call yourself
02:41 

02:41 like a software engineer am I really one
02:44 

02:44 if I can I I have never technically
02:46 

02:46 built like a full-fledged app you know
02:50 

02:50 and that kind of self-doubt does uh
02:52 

02:52 perpetuate I think the other perspective
02:54 

02:54 I had was also now I wouldn't consider
02:57 

02:57 myself senior more mid-grade I realize I
02:59 

02:59 still have that that just that now I
03:01 

03:01 have more experience and lived
03:03 

03:03 experiences to advise me that I am not
03:06 

03:06 the stupidest person in the room and
03:08 

03:08 that I am qualified to actually voice my
03:11 

03:11 opinions but I think even more so rather
03:13 

03:13 than coming from a mid level person like
03:16 

03:16 myself you know Salone as somebody
03:18 

03:18 senior would you say that that is
03:20 

03:20 something that you're still dealing with
03:21 

03:21 uh presently definitely imposer syndrome
03:24 

03:24 for me kind of comes and remains there
03:28 

03:28 for some time and then goes away until
03:30 

03:30 I've figure it out and I think it's
03:31 

03:31 normal especially when something doesn't
03:34 

03:34 go my way it it's deaths when it kind of
03:37 

03:37 hits me again like oh no I oh this sucks
03:41 

03:41 and and I can't do this anymore and like
03:43 

03:43 everyone's smarter around me how do like
03:45 

03:45 I can't I can't I can't do it but that's
03:48 

03:48 where my self-awareness kicks in you
03:49 

03:49 know like be aware that okay you are
03:52 

03:52 facing something feeling something and
03:55 

03:55 one thing that really works for me when
03:58 

03:58 when I face it face this kind of thing
04:00 

04:00 just remembering that you're not stupid
04:04 

04:04 okay you're you're not it's okay to be
04:07 

04:07 the not the smartest person in the room
04:09 

04:09 that's good that means that people
04:11 

04:11 around you are smarter than you and you
04:13 

04:13 get to learn from them like look at it
04:15 

04:15 in a positive way if you were the
04:18 

04:18 smartest person in the room who are you
04:20 

04:20 going to learn from right so it's good
04:22 

04:22 to have smarter people in the room then
04:24 

04:24 you but of course always look at how can
04:26 

04:26 you also be as smart as them so that's
04:29 

04:29 good that's a good thing really but of
04:32 

04:32 course there are times where you spiral
04:34 

04:34 into this thing where I can't do it uh
04:37 

04:37 like you know everyone's everyone's just
04:39 

04:39 better than me let let them handle this
04:41 

04:41 project or like let them do this I I
04:44 

04:44 can't do it uh that's when you have to
04:46 

04:46 remember there must be something that
04:48 

04:48 you have done right right for example
04:50 

04:50 the reason you in the
04:52 

04:52 workplace probably had to pass the
04:54 

04:54 interview and software engineering
04:55 

04:55 interview is like five six rounds you
04:58 

04:58 you did that that's number one okay that
05:01 

05:01 you have something in you and always
05:04 

05:04 writing down your achievements every
05:07 

05:07 even if it's small big that's not only
05:09 

05:09 good for like your kpi and like talking
05:11 

05:11 one-on-one with your leads and stuff but
05:13 

05:13 it's also good as a memory for you that
05:16 

05:16 I achieved this I did this I did this
05:18 

05:18 especially when you know other
05:20 

05:20 colleagues commented on you or like tked
05:22 

05:22 you in public or like oh kudos to Salon
05:25 

05:25 for doing this screenshot it keep it
05:28 

05:28 keep it with you and then from time to
05:30 

05:30 look at it that's like a sense of like
05:32 

05:32 you did something you you are good you
05:35 

05:35 know so it's okay to have some failures
05:37 

05:37 but also there were some good parts as
05:39 

05:39 well that's that's something that works
05:41 

05:41 for me I also learned this thing from
05:43 

05:43 Human actually uh where she said that I
05:45 

05:45 should also try to give kudos to my team
05:49 

05:49 members uh when they do something good
05:52 

05:52 and then usually they will do the same
05:54 

05:54 back to you so these kind small small
05:56 

05:56 winds here and there kind of adds up
05:59 

05:59 this is the the main thing that kind of
06:01 

06:01 keeps me up but I would definitely say
06:03 

06:03 it's it's normal to feel that way what
06:06 

06:06 about yourself Victoria like did you
06:08 

06:08 have any personal experiences or like
06:11 

06:11 yeah I I have a personal anecdote on
06:14 

06:14 this I even wrote an article about this
06:16 

06:16 like oh like a while back yeah so
06:19 

06:19 basically when I first pivot into Tech I
06:22 

06:22 join a lot of heck andon right just to
06:24 

06:24 learn something from everyone I remember
06:26 

06:26 joining this random group of people and
06:29 

06:29 then like I was still learning
06:30 

06:30 JavaScript at the time so I'm not very
06:32 

06:32 familiar with no JS so they asked me to
06:35 

06:35 you know set up an environment and all
06:37 

06:37 that and then I asked um Can someone
06:40 

06:40 guide me how do I do this and then one
06:42 

06:42 person was like you don't even know how
06:43 

06:43 to do something like this oh somebody
06:45 

06:45 said that yeah and honestly at the time
06:48 

06:48 I was still pivoting right so obviously
06:50 

06:50 it hurts my confidence but I also know
06:53 

06:53 that whatever this person say it is the
06:55 

06:55 truth after I learned more so now that I
06:57 

06:57 become like around mid level just being
06:60 

06:60 aware of that there's so many things
07:01 

07:01 that I don't know it makes me feel like
07:03 

07:03 I'm never good enough right and also
07:05 

07:05 partly because I always imagine if I had
07:08 

07:08 that fouryear education like proper
07:11 

07:11 formal education in CS I might have been
07:14 

07:14 a lot better than I am currently so I
07:17 

07:17 always had that what if scenario stuck
07:19 

07:19 in my mind and that feeds into my
07:22 

07:22 imposter syndrome like especially my
07:24 

07:24 early days of tech blogging I'll be like
07:26 

07:26 do I even have the right to write about
07:28 

07:28 this like I'm already knowledgeable
07:30 

07:30 about this now but what if someone who
07:32 

07:32 had formal CS education can write it
07:35 

07:35 better than me or can explain it better
07:37 

07:37 than me cuz they know other CS people
07:39 

07:39 usually how I solve my own problems is I
07:41 

07:41 just do a lot of research so I research
07:44 

07:44 a lot into what causes impul syndrome
07:47 

07:47 and one of the things I found during my
07:48 

07:48 research is is the Dunning Krueger
07:50 

07:50 effect so there is this Dunning Krueger
07:52 

07:52 effect where the line will goes up and
07:54 

07:54 up so the more things you know the more
07:56 

07:56 confidence you feel as well as times go
07:58 

07:58 by but then you'll reach a Peak where
07:60 

07:60 you think you know everything and then
08:02 

08:02 you feel this like sense of confidence
08:04 

08:04 like oh I'm so great but that's actually
08:06 

08:06 the dangerous Peak is the peak of
08:08 

08:08 arrogance complacency but then I've
08:11 

08:11 actually before I knew it I have passed
08:13 

08:13 that Peak so I'm like in the peak where
08:16 

08:16 I'm down below like my confidence level
08:18 

08:18 is like bottom but actually I have like
08:22 

08:22 more experience gained it's kind of an
08:24 

08:24 irony like a contradiction but that's
08:26 

08:26 how imposter syndrome actually came
08:28 

08:28 about because when people people know
08:30 

08:30 more they also know that they don't know
08:33 

08:33 so much they also realize that they
08:35 

08:35 don't know so much and so that causes
08:36 

08:36 the Imposter syndrome so after I
08:39 

08:39 research about that and then I become
08:41 

08:41 aware of that I had this like aha moment
08:44 

08:44 like oh okay so in a way it it helps me
08:47 

08:47 like reaffirm myself that okay that
08:49 

08:49 means I I know more now that's why I
08:52 

08:52 know how much I don't know and that's
08:54 

08:54 why syndrome the more you know the more
08:57 

08:57 you don't you know you don't know you
08:58 

08:58 don't know exactly
08:60 

09:00 and I think it tends uh this tends to
09:03 

09:03 happen more perhaps in like our industry
09:06 

09:06 because we're kind of trained to
09:08 

09:08 constantly be curious and to find out
09:11 

09:11 more and the more you find out the more
09:13 

09:13 you find out you don't know so in that
09:16 

09:16 sense like we we hardly ever perhaps
09:18 

09:18 like reach that Peak because every time
09:21 

09:21 we think we know more we open more gates
09:24 

09:24 to like wow there's a thousand other
09:26 

09:26 things that we don't know and the thing
09:27 

09:27 about like everything is interconnected
09:29 

09:29 right you think like you're you're just
09:31 

09:31 starting out learning how to build like
09:33 

09:33 a note GS app and before you know it
09:35 

09:35 you're looking into cicd and before you
09:38 

09:38 know it you're looking into cloud
09:40 

09:40 computing as well and you're like I can
09:42 

09:42 never do this like I just constantly am
09:45 

09:45 in a state of I don't know and then you
09:47 

09:47 add that to the fact that in the world
09:49 

09:49 in a very fast-paced world of check
09:51 

09:51 there's always something new there's
09:53 

09:53 always a new library a new framework a
09:55 

09:55 new language a new just disruptive
09:58 

09:58 technology and concept
10:00 

10:00 that even if you reach if you somehow
10:03 

10:03 reach that Peak right tomorrow the news
10:05 

10:05 comes out that like there's something
10:07 

10:07 new and you realize wow okay that's
10:08 

10:08 something new I don't know and I think
10:11 

10:11 that's why we're constantly stuck in a
10:12 

10:12 loop but I love that you brought it up
10:14 

10:14 that it is normal especially in our
10:17 

10:17 industry that to feel like you don't
10:19 

10:19 know enough to feel like there are
10:21 

10:21 people smarter than you is actually a
10:24 

10:24 good thing because I think a lot of
10:26 

10:26 people viy to be the smartest person in
10:27 

10:27 the room but I've been in scenario SC
10:29 

10:29 arios where and not not in an arrogant
10:32 

10:32 flamboyant way but I've been in crowds
10:35 

10:35 where I realized I wasn't getting
10:36 

10:36 inspired by anyone and I just kind of
10:39 

10:39 felt very out of place and I feel like
10:41 

10:41 I'm constantly searching to be in a room
10:44 

10:44 where there's always something that I
10:46 

10:46 can learn from others that I'm not the
10:48 

10:48 smartest person in the room I we we want
10:50 

10:50 that and We crave for that and that
10:52 

10:52 combined with the dun Krueger effect you
10:54 

10:54 mentioned yeah just makes so much sense
10:57 

10:57 now we've been uh organize events that
11:01 

11:01 are mostly like techies that are
11:02 

11:02 concentrated and say like oh uh learn
11:05 

11:05 cloud computing or like whatever it's
11:07 

11:07 it's very centered around technical
11:08 

11:08 workshops and learning so the people who
11:10 

11:10 attend are looking for knowledge but
11:12 

11:12 there are also events that are very
11:14 

11:14 intentional towards like uh networking
11:17 

11:17 startups so you know putting your skill
11:19 

11:19 sets out there it's meant for that you
11:21 

11:21 know and then it's a different crowd of
11:22 

11:22 people perhaps less technical maybe more
11:25 

11:25 functional but the intention of those
11:27 

11:27 events is to get investors is to get
11:28 

11:28 people to buy in and get clients right
11:31 

11:31 so instead of like showing that you
11:33 

11:33 don't know the intention of those kinds
11:34 

11:34 of events is to show that you know these
11:37 

11:37 two types of events I've been to and
11:39 

11:39 I've realized the Dunning Krueger effect
11:42 

11:42 I guess you you would have to
11:44 

11:44 demonstrate that you're at a peak of
11:46 

11:46 that for the latter because you need to
11:48 

11:48 show people that you are an expert and
11:51 

11:51 even if deep down you don't feel like
11:53 

11:53 let's say I'm an AI expert now you know
11:56 

11:56 like oh there's still so much I don't
11:58 

11:58 know about l and I don't necessarily
12:01 

12:01 know like the latest technology but in
12:04 

12:04 that event you have to tell everybody
12:05 

12:05 that I am an expert because if you don't
12:07 

12:07 you're never going to get clients you're
12:09 

12:09 never going to get that investment so I
12:11 

12:11 understand that the reverse of impos
12:14 

12:14 syndrome is important and perhaps more
12:17 

12:17 people in the business D functions are
12:20 

12:20 forced to overcome that that syndrome um
12:23 

12:23 more readily because their job relies on
12:26 

12:26 it so that's why I learned something
12:28 

12:28 from that also through a book is James
12:31 

12:31 Clear Atomic habits oh so what he say is
12:34 

12:34 like like let's say you want to get into
12:36 

12:36 a habit of like you know eating healthy
12:38 

12:38 don't say I'm going to eat healthy you
12:41 

12:41 say to yourself I am a healthy eater so
12:44 

12:44 you already tell yourself I'm a healthy
12:46 

12:46 eater which means you will reaffirm
12:48 

12:48 yourself I am this person and that's why
12:51 

12:51 you will have to stick to these habits
12:53 

12:53 so for me when I first start my blog I
12:55 

12:55 put like cuz I was a freelance web
12:57 

12:57 developer so I put like aspire sofware
12:60 

12:60 engineer or something and I see a lot of
13:02 

13:02 my readers do that aspiring something
13:04 

13:04 something right but they will constantly
13:06 

13:06 if you put aspiring that means it's like
13:08 

13:08 someday you're going to be so if you
13:10 

13:10 remove that you say I am now a software
13:13 

13:13 engineer so you put your mind into that
13:16 

13:16 kind of like you brainwash yourself
13:17 

13:17 right then you can like in a way fake it
13:19 

13:19 till you make it to fake it to you make
13:21 

13:21 it sometimes that strategy works so that
13:23 

13:23 is what I learned from James Clear he's
13:25 

13:25 like don't say you are going to be a
13:27 

13:27 marathon runner say you are now a
13:29 

13:29 marathon on Runner and it will make you
13:31 

13:31 run and go every day so that is what I
13:34 

13:34 learned so I remove all the aspiring
13:36 

13:36 from my like now I'm no longer aspiring
13:38 

13:38 I already am so I said that all to my
13:41 

13:41 readers as well those who like email me
13:43 

13:43 like how do I you know Advance how do I
13:45 

13:45 get out of this mindset I say with all
13:47 

13:47 you're aspiring cuz it doesn't matter
13:50 

13:50 you know if you want to be that person
13:52 

13:52 just say you're that person now it'll
13:54 

13:54 help you build that confidence so that's
13:56 

13:56 how you counteract kind of but you'll
13:59 

13:59 still get it from time to time because
14:00 

14:00 like you mentioned Natasha the nature of
14:02 

14:02 our work is to be curious and to know
14:04 

14:04 what we don't know so we can find out
14:05 

14:05 more so it'll hit us from time to time
14:07 

14:07 but having that um non aspiring and only
14:11 

14:11 like knowing what we are like that that
14:14 

14:14 really helps yeah manifestation that's
14:16 

14:16 like what mentioned yeah it's that
14:19 

14:19 manifestation that help I would say this
14:21 

14:21 pry SM because like literally we always
14:23 

14:23 do our introductions right like hey I'm
14:25 

14:25 solution and every time I do that
14:27 

14:27 introduction I I still feel that tinch
14:30 

14:30 of discomfort of saying like hi I'm
14:32 

14:32 Natasha I'm a software engineer and but
14:35 

14:35 there's I think you guys will see but
14:37 

14:37 there's always the hesitance but I tell
14:39 

14:39 myself I have to put myself out there
14:41 

14:41 and fake it till I make it because you
14:42 

14:42 know the podcast relies on it our labels
14:44 

14:44 are important but now that you talk
14:46 

14:46 about like the idea of that kind of
14:49 

14:49 manifestation as a form of affirmation
14:51 

14:51 that you were talking about um it it
14:54 

14:54 does make sense now because it's not
14:56 

14:56 just about me anymore it's also you know
14:58 

14:58 if I under bu so I undermine both of you
15:00 

15:00 as well and that's not fair so I think
15:03 

15:03 that's what works for me specifically is
15:05 

15:05 to see how I can relate that to a higher
15:09 

15:09 objective um and I guess I would
15:12 

15:12 classify myself as a very highly
15:14 

15:14 sensitive empathetic person you know if
15:16 

15:16 I don't say that I'm a software engineer
15:18 

15:18 today how am I going to face like say
15:21 

15:21 the mentees that I'm mentoring you know
15:24 

15:24 and then when people uh find out that
15:27 

15:27 they're my Mente what are they going to
15:28 

15:28 think of them I know this is probably
15:29 

15:29 not like a very healthy way no no I
15:32 

15:32 actually have that I like sometimes when
15:34 

15:34 I face imposter syndrome or just low
15:37 

15:37 confidence in in some sense I'll always
15:40 

15:40 think to myself that oh but I'm not
15:42 

15:42 director of women devs I'm representing
15:46 

15:46 woms uh so for them like that kind of
15:49 

15:49 give you some inspiration or like
15:52 

15:52 motivation to like no for all the women
15:54 

15:54 livs out there I got I need to like
15:57 

15:57 figure this out and I'll learn I'll I'll
16:01 

16:01 do it well and and she has done it very
16:04 

16:04 well yes you have yeah especially like
16:08 

16:08 representing a whole Community as you
16:10 

16:10 still you as well as our other co-
16:12 

16:12 director toelle St so steadfast and hit
16:14 

16:14 strong but I'm sure there was a lot of
16:16 

16:16 self-doubt that played in between where
16:18 

16:18 you were thinking like even as maybe
16:20 

16:20 even as a director I wasn't able to do
16:22 

16:22 anything about this I didn't even have
16:23 

16:23 as much information where people were
16:25 

16:25 just like what's happening and stuff
16:26 

16:26 like that it's the whole community that
16:28 

16:28 we bring bringing forward and also like
16:31 

16:31 to know that the community is there like
16:34 

16:34 I know like if anything you know we have
16:36 

16:36 so many volunteers who are very
16:38 

16:38 passionate about it they are right there
16:40 

16:40 they can they can help us out yeah I
16:44 

16:44 think that's what makes me like I
16:46 

16:46 already know from the start even when
16:48 

16:48 woman who code was uh down for a while
16:51 

16:51 like I have no doubts that soney would
16:53 

16:53 somehow like just rise it back up like I
16:56 

16:56 was just waiting for that message until
16:58 

16:58 someone say we're back
16:60 

16:60 you know like I know I somehow just know
17:02 

17:02 cuz I know that L strong leader but
17:05 

17:05 highly empathetic as well so she has all
17:07 

17:07 the good benefits of like a the strength
17:10 

17:10 of a leader screenshot put in
17:13 

17:13 mind a don't need the screenshot rewatch
17:17 

17:17 the video I think that's a very strong
17:20 

17:20 um a little bit extreme way of like
17:22 

17:22 keeping yourself going but I do think
17:23 

17:23 like in a very practical sense it does
17:26 

17:26 work so definitely yeah but rather um I
17:30 

17:30 think also what helps is that the moment
17:33 

17:33 that you feel and acknowledge those
17:35 

17:35 feelings coming that self-doubt uh it's
17:38 

17:38 not to lie to yourself like it doesn't
17:40 

17:40 matter and stuff like that it's to sit
17:42 

17:42 in it and then acknowledge okay I'm
17:44 

17:44 feeling doubtful and but I do know it is
17:47 

17:47 fleeting it will go away but what other
17:49 

17:49 things I have to do to overcome this
17:51 

17:51 right now and she was like okay this is
17:53 

17:53 going to be super random not connected
17:55 

17:55 to anything that we did at all I give
17:57 

17:57 you all these quotes and these oh yes
17:59 

17:59 yes thought I will need someone else to
18:02 

18:02 look at everything that I've talked to
18:04 

18:04 myself already cuz we too w
