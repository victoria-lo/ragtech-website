00:00 I'm also incredibly cheap. I think both
00:02 

00:02 of you know that already. I refuse to
00:04 

00:04 even pay like 10 cents for anything and
00:06 

00:06 I need to find and exhaust all my
00:08 

00:08 options
00:09 

00:09 uh until I pay a single cent for a third
00:11 

00:11 party tool.
00:14 

00:14 [Music]
00:16 

00:16 So, as you know with blogging um with
00:18 

00:18 content management systems, you usually
00:20 

00:20 need to pay a fee and then they'll have
00:22 

00:22 restrictions and stuff like that. And it
00:23 

00:23 was really hard to work with the APIs
00:26 

00:26 specifically when I wanted like this
00:27 

00:27 specific look as well. Um so with this I
00:32 

00:32 actually wrote everything in markdown.
00:35 

00:35 So this was a special part where my blog
00:40 

00:40 this is how like my blog is written in
00:43 

00:43 my code repository itself in
00:48 

00:48 in markdown like this and I basically
00:52 

00:52 like um did it in such a way such that
00:56 

00:56 it would um render the markdown in the
01:00 

01:00 specific way I wanted. So basically I
01:03 

01:03 didn't have to use a content management
01:04 

01:04 system. I I would write it would just be
01:07 

01:07 as simple as adding like a file here and
01:10 

01:10 then just in a specific like format that
01:13 

01:13 I set for myself. It would render the
01:17 

01:17 blog post.
01:19 

01:19 Yeah. I also based this off of Medium
01:20 

01:20 because it was just like what's a good
01:22 

01:22 reading format. At first it was like I
01:23 

01:23 was using a lot of fun fonts and stuff
01:25 

01:25 like that and then I read it I was like
01:26 

01:26 wow it's actually kind of hard to read.
01:29 

01:29 So um
01:30 

01:30 >> yeah this this one
01:32 

01:32 >> I do one small feedback because I'm a
01:34 

01:34 I'm a technical writer myself is that
01:37 

01:37 you should add tags. So like in the
01:39 

01:39 markdown if you can have like tags you
01:41 

01:41 know so like if it's React or if it's um
01:45 

01:45 if it's about TypeScript you know so
01:48 

01:48 that's it's good for SEO as well if you
01:50 

01:50 can
01:50 

01:50 >> that's true yeah I never thought about
01:52 

01:52 that. So this is why like I think for
01:54 

01:54 the next like um revamp I actually want
01:57 

01:57 to um go to a proper like content
02:00 

02:00 management system so SEO can be
02:03 

02:03 considered. I wasn't considering SEO at
02:04 

02:04 that point of time because I was just
02:06 

02:06 like I just want to like do something
02:07 

02:07 for fun. But now after like exploring
02:10 

02:10 especially when you introduce us to
02:12 

02:12 hashnote through the rect blog I
02:14 

02:14 realized SEO is really important if you
02:16 

02:16 want people to find you and um by the
02:19 

02:19 way for the audience members SEO stands
02:21 

02:21 for search engine optimization. It's
02:23 

02:23 kind of like when you go on like any
02:25 

02:25 search engine and um you you hit uh you
02:30 

02:30 search any keyword you would want your
02:32 

02:32 article or your content to go up to the
02:35 

02:35 top of that search engine. So, search
02:37 

02:37 engine optimization is optimizing your
02:40 

02:40 own um content to be flagged out at the
02:44 

02:44 very top by search engines. And here
02:46 

02:46 Victoria is basically saying,
02:48 

02:48 >> "Yeah, tags are important." And a lot of
02:50 

02:50 like uh content management systems um
02:53 

02:53 and blogging platforms like hash node,
02:55 

02:55 the one we use for rag tech blog or like
02:58 

02:58 medium, they have inbuilt like search
03:00 

03:00 engine optimization. So like the people
03:02 

03:02 who write the posts don't have to like
03:04 

03:04 worry about it. Um, like for me right
03:08 

03:08 now, I don't think like mine comes up.
03:11 

03:11 Um,
03:12 

03:12 even even if I were to Google it, I
03:15 

03:15 don't think mine would see like nothing
03:17 

03:17 comes up even though I literally Googled
03:19 

03:19 like the exact title. But you can see
03:22 

03:22 like Reddit comes up, Medium comes up
03:24 

03:24 because Kora comes up because these are
03:26 

03:26 like platforms that uh already have like
03:30 

03:30 tags built in like Victoria mentioned
03:32 

03:32 and everything else. So yeah, that's why
03:36 

03:36 I was kind of considering I should
03:38 

03:38 probably might
03:41 

03:41 but
03:43 

03:43 need to
03:43 

03:43 >> you could just you could just like write
03:45 

03:45 on these other platforms and put a link
03:49 

03:49 >> so
03:52 

03:52 you're saying I should like let's say
03:54 

03:54 say for a medium I write there and then
03:56 

03:56 I link to my website
03:59 

03:59 >> and then those uh icons that you have on
04:02 

04:02 your tech blog the diary page. Those
04:05 

04:05 small icons are just hyperlinks.
04:09 

04:09 >> Oh, to to like the uh content management
04:11 

04:11 system platform.
04:12 

04:12 >> Yeah.
04:14 

04:14 >> Or maybe just the read more button here
04:16 

04:16 on the left side. The read more button
04:18 

04:18 would be to
04:19 

04:19 >> That's true.
04:20 

04:20 >> The actual platform.
04:22 

04:22 >> That's true. So if I were to use like
04:24 

04:24 their API, it would just be like uh uh
04:27 

04:27 trying to request the title and maybe
04:30 

04:30 like just a summary from like my indiv.
04:33 

04:33 >> Yeah, if they have. So I don't know if
04:34 

04:34 they provide such APIs.
04:37 

04:37 >> Yeah, I would need to like kind of
04:38 

04:38 explore like see if hashnote has it. I
04:41 

04:41 don't think medium
04:42 

04:42 >> hashnote has Yeah, definitely has.
04:44 

04:44 >> Yeah. Yeah, I've I've explored hashnote
04:47 

04:47 API before. The thing is
04:49 

04:49 >> Yeah. Yeah, they have. But uh Hashnote
04:51 

04:51 uses GraphQL A API.
04:54 

04:54 >> So you'll need Yeah, but they do have
04:56 

04:56 it. The thing I'm concerned about is if
04:58 

04:58 you redirect like from your main website
05:01 

05:01 to the hashnote, let's say like you have
05:04 

05:04 a all the full article written there
05:06 

05:06 instead of your own website, then most
05:08 

05:08 of the traffic would end up going to
05:09 

05:09 hashnote, right? But if you want your
05:12 

05:12 main website to be the main traffic then
05:16 

05:16 I would say you need to keep the
05:19 

05:19 articles there. So maybe you can do like
05:22 

05:22 opposite of it. So it's like on medium
05:24 

05:24 or on other blogging platforms you can
05:26 

05:26 write a good amount of your article and
05:29 

05:29 then you say read more. You you you
05:31 

05:31 redirect them to your main website read
05:33 

05:33 more and minor website if you want the
05:35 

05:35 traffic to be on your website. So it
05:37 

05:37 depends where you want people to visit
05:40 

05:40 more. Is it your medium page or your
05:42 

05:42 main website?
05:44 

05:44 >> That's
05:45 

05:45 I honestly haven't thought about that. I
05:47 

05:47 mean, I'm not earning anything from the
05:50 

05:50 traffic to my website. I think my
05:52 

05:52 website is just more of like a landing
05:55 

05:55 point to a landing page landing
05:57 

05:57 >> page. So, so it depends on on what you
05:59 

05:59 want. Yeah. But if you're making like
06:01 

06:01 your website your main then you know
06:04 

06:04 after every article you can also link.
06:06 

06:06 So backlinking is also good for SEO. So
06:09 

06:09 you can link to your own website right?
06:11 

06:11 So for example your current uh article
06:14 

06:14 the about the monor repo after that you
06:17 

06:17 say read more like here like at the
06:19 

06:19 bottom of the article you can say read
06:20 

06:20 more.
06:21 

06:21 >> So let's say this is like hash note and
06:24 

06:24 then underneath it I'll have like read
06:27 

06:27 more.
06:28 

06:28 >> Yeah
06:30 

06:30 >> something. I'm also thinking maybe it
06:32 

06:32 could just be uh to know more about the
06:35 

06:35 writer Natasha, go back to my website.
06:38 

06:38 That kind of thing. That's that's the
06:41 

06:41 because your website is more for your
06:43 

06:43 portfolio and what who is Natasha. It's
06:46 

06:46 not really about blogs.
06:49 

06:49 >> Yeah. Yeah.
06:50 

06:50 >> Right. So,
06:53 

06:53 >> yeah. It's it's it's more about what is
06:55 

06:55 the point what is the intent of your
06:58 

06:58 blog of your website.
07:01 

07:01 >> That's true. Okay. Okay. I I
07:04 

07:04 >> definitely some devs uh use their
07:07 

07:07 personal website as a blog as well. Some
07:09 

07:09 devs do that. So it depends what if you
07:13 

07:13 want to off offshore your blog to an a
07:15 

07:15 blogging platform that's also fine.
07:17 

07:17 >> Yeah.
07:18 

07:18 >> What about for you Victoria? Like how do
07:20 

07:20 you do it? So currently my blog itself
07:23 

07:23 is my entire personal portfolio/brand.
07:26 

07:26 So so that's why I just
07:30 

07:30 low Victoria right?
07:32 

07:32 >> Yeah. Yeah.
07:34 

07:34 >> Actually with a dash with with a dash
07:35 

07:35 low- Victoria.
07:38 

07:38 >> Yeah. So my entire portfolio is my
07:41 

07:41 articles since I I want my personal
07:44 

07:44 brand to be about writing. So that's why
07:46 

07:46 I don't find it necessary to have to
07:49 

07:49 offshore blog and my
07:52 

07:52 >> and Oh yeah. So actually I'm similar to
07:56 

07:56 you as in like I draw it by myself like
07:58 

07:58 this this GIF I draw it myself
08:02 

08:02 >> and then I use CSS to animate the the
08:05 

08:05 words.
08:06 

08:06 >> Oh
08:07 

08:07 >> yeah that's all I did but the art itself
08:10 

08:10 I draw it with Photoshop.
08:12 

08:12 >> Oh you use Photoshop?
08:15 

08:15 Yeah,
08:16 

08:16 >> it's so cool to see both of your
08:18 

08:18 personalities on your websites
08:21 

08:21 >> because this literally what my desk look
08:23 

08:23 like. My desk look like a monitor and my
08:26 

08:26 switch is literally on my right side
08:27 

08:27 right now and my cup is also on my right
08:30 

08:30 side.
08:30 

08:30 >> I don't have books right now. I have
08:32 

08:32 post-it notes right now. But and I don't
08:34 

08:34 have a picture of myself. That's that's
08:35 

08:35 the only thing that's different. The
08:36 

08:36 left side.
08:37 

08:37 >> It's you with TV and you don't have
08:39 

08:39 glasses right now. like right now and
08:42 

08:42 >> yeah I'm undergoing transformation.
08:47 

08:47 >> Do you have a personal website?
08:50 

08:50 >> I don't have a personal website but you
08:52 

08:52 can also go to my medium page. So I just
08:55 

08:55 write on medium and
08:58 

08:58 yeah maybe just
09:01 

09:01 uh that's yeah single L in my name.
09:04 

09:04 >> Oh why did I put two L's?
09:06 

09:06 this one.
09:08 

09:08 >> Uh, no. Maybe
09:11 

09:11 I don't think this is
09:14 

09:14 >> SEO. SEO is important. Everybody
09:17 

09:17 >> Yeah, this one looks me. The first one.
09:21 

09:21 >> Ah, wait. I didn't even know that you
09:23 

09:23 had a medium.
09:25 

09:25 >> Look at the stuff we're finding out
09:26 

09:26 about each other and finding out about
09:28 

09:28 SEO. Isn't that great? So now you know
09:30 

09:30 that if you type salon core medium then
09:33 

09:33 your thing comes out but salon medium
09:35 

09:35 doesn't come up.
09:37 

09:37 >> Also I also have a similar uh photo
09:40 

09:40 thingy that I created. I think if you go
09:42 

09:42 to like my first article
09:45 

09:45 uh I remember where it would be. Yeah
09:48 

09:48 the first one all the way
09:50 

09:50 >> I'm at the bottom.
09:53 

09:53 Or maybe I should go to lists
09:56 

09:56 blockchain. No about
09:58 

09:58 >> no
10:01 

10:01 no okay
10:03 

10:03 uh one of the article oh uh can you go
10:05
