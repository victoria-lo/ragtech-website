00:00 I've always struggled with trying to
00:03 

00:03 define my personal brand and I've spent
00:06 

00:06 the whole of the last year just trying
00:08 

00:08 to figure that out and I think the not
00:10 

00:10 problem but I I'm just a person with
00:13 

00:13 many many interests. I had a friend who
00:15 

00:15 described me as a divergent inquisitive
00:18 

00:18 [Music]
00:22 

00:22 >> like what is your intention with the
00:24 

00:24 with your personal website?
00:27 

00:27 >> Okay, this is a very good question. you
00:29 

00:29 know how like Victoria was like very
00:31 

00:31 clear when she was just like yeah my
00:33 

00:33 personal website like my personal brand
00:34 

00:34 is my technical blogging it was very
00:36 

00:36 clearcut for her. Um I think for me I've
00:39 

00:39 always struggled with like trying to
00:42 

00:42 define my personal brand and I've spent
00:45 

00:45 the whole of like the last year just
00:48 

00:48 trying to figure that out and I think
00:50 

00:50 the not problem but I always fall back
00:52 

00:52 to like I I'm just a person with many
00:55 

00:55 many interests. Um, I had a friend who
00:58 

00:58 described me as a divergent inquisitive.
00:60 

00:60 Like I just want to do everything and
01:01 

01:01 try everything and I'm I'm never like
01:04 

01:04 just like a podcaster or just just like
01:06 

01:06 a software engineer or like just like a
01:08 

01:08 web comic art or whatever. And I but but
01:11 

01:11 it makes it very hard to like optimize
01:14 

01:14 like my personal brand be it in terms of
01:16 

01:16 SEO, be it in terms of like the social
01:18 

01:18 media stuff that I've been just kind of
01:20 

01:20 experimenting and doing. I don't know
01:22 

01:22 where to park myself. And I think I
01:24 

01:24 don't know if that's a problem though.
01:26 

01:26 Like I know it's a problem in the sense
01:29 

01:29 of like optimizing for traffic, but I
01:32 

01:32 don't think it it's not it's not a
01:34 

01:34 problem for like me myself in terms of
01:36 

01:36 like how I see myself, but I know it's a
01:39 

01:39 problem in terms of like how people see
01:41 

01:41 me, I guess.
01:43 

01:43 >> Yeah.
01:43 

01:43 >> So you're in your exploration phase. So
01:45 

01:45 you're just exploring.
01:47 

01:47 >> I feel like my identity is the the
01:50 

01:50 exploration phase.
01:52 

01:52 I'm just exploring all the time.
01:56 

01:56 >> You're Natasha the Explorer.
01:57 

01:57 >> I'm not Dora the Explorer. I'm Natasha
01:59 

01:59 the Explorer.
02:01 

02:01 >> Well, even Dora has an identity. She
02:03 

02:03 always wears that pink shirt with the
02:05 

02:05 yellow pants with her monkey. I I like
02:08 

02:08 wear things that are different all the
02:09 

02:09 time. And I Okay, I have two cats, but I
02:13 

02:13 guess I guess they put Oh my gosh, she
02:15 

02:15 looks like boots.
02:19 

02:19 >> Boots. Gray.
02:21 

02:21 Yeah. But
02:23 

02:23 >> oh, I kind of like that though. Like
02:25 

02:25 just saying that I'm an explorer. I've
02:27 

02:27 recently started calling myself a so a
02:29 

02:29 social experiment
02:32 

02:32 because it's like software engineer SE,
02:34 

02:34 right? Then social experiment SE.
02:38 

02:38 But okay, I don't think anybody gets
02:40 

02:40 that pun but
02:45 

02:45 >> Yay. I expect to get it. Yay. That that
02:50 

02:50 was my
02:52 

02:52 >> like a benchmark. I didn't expect salon
02:54 

02:54 to get it.
02:55 

02:55 >> No, no, no. That's not what I meant
02:58 

02:58 because you're usually like really like
03:00 

03:00 strict at at um like non serious.
03:05 

03:05 >> Yeah. And you were like when you laugh I
03:07 

03:07 was like validation.
03:11 

03:11 But yes, please like give me I don't
03:13 

03:13 know give me feedback on like I I really
03:15 

03:15 like the idea of like explorer. Maybe I
03:18 

03:18 maybe I should kind of like think about
03:20 

03:20 my personal brand a little bit. Um, but
03:23 

03:23 I guess like the entire entire like web
03:27 

03:27 folio what I wanted to showcase was that
03:29 

03:29 I was definitely more than just a
03:31 

03:31 software engineer. But it's just that
03:33 

03:33 now I feel like I also have to like
03:35 

03:35 start categorizing them more like what
03:38 

03:38 else but I also using software engineer
03:42 

03:42 as an anchor is more like career focused
03:45 

03:45 than anything, right? It's like, oh, um,
03:48 

03:48 obviously when I'm finding jobs, my main
03:50 

03:50 vocation and trade is software engineer.
03:52 

03:52 Um, but to say that that's my primary
03:55 

03:55 identity, it's also like not so true.
03:58 

03:58 And now like that we're doing the
03:59 

03:59 podcast also, I wanted to like really
04:01 

04:01 put the podcaster part like front and
04:03 

04:03 center as well.
04:05 

04:05 >> Yeah. And then also women devs. So
04:07 

04:07 that's why I chose like these three
04:09 

04:09 labels.
04:11 

04:11 But, you know, more than those labels,
04:14 

04:14 I'm just an adult in a late 20s figuring
04:16 

04:16 out life, society, and my purpose in it.
04:18 

04:18 Explorer,
04:20 

04:20 I will probably put the door on the
04:22 

04:22 explorer thing.
04:23 

04:23 >> I don't know if this helps, but Jeff
04:25 

04:25 Bezos once said that your personal brand
04:27 

04:27 is basically something that people talk
04:30 

04:30 about you when you're not in the room.
04:33 

04:33 That's the definition of a personal
04:35 

04:35 brand.
04:35 

04:35 >> Okay, I'm going to shut off right now um
04:38 

04:38 and then review the recording.
04:41 

04:41 Bye guys.
04:43 

04:43 >> Yeah, it's basically what do you want to
04:45 

04:45 be known for? Yeah. What what do you
04:47 

04:47 want people to think of when they hear
04:50 

04:50 when they see your name, see or hear
04:51 

04:51 about you that that's your personal
04:53 

04:53 brand?
04:53 

04:53 >> Actually that also reminds me that
04:55 

04:55 there's I don't know if you know Jetty
04:57 

04:57 even he wrote in one of his books uh
04:60 

04:60 that came out which is that uh if you
05:02 

05:02 want to know what you are good at ask
05:05 

05:05 your friends and family what they think
05:08 

05:08 you are good at. that basically that
05:10 

05:10 becomes the thing that you're good at or
05:13 

05:13 that's your identity, right? If you ask
05:15 

05:15 people what you're known for.
05:18 

05:18 >> If I ask my parents, they'll say I talk
05:21 

05:21 a lot
05:22 

05:22 >> or like why do people come to you for
05:25 

05:25 help? What help do they need from you?
05:28 

05:28 >> Maybe that's your identity or that's
05:30 

05:30 what you're good at.
05:33 

05:33 Like for the longest time I had I
05:34 

05:34 thought about this question and the at
05:37 

05:37 least my family the reason why they come
05:39 

05:39 to me was to can you help me create a
05:41 

05:41 poster create a birthday card for my
05:44 

05:44 niece and nephew. I was like am I a
05:47 

05:47 poster creator?
05:52 

05:52 >> You're more than that.
05:53 

05:53 >> I'm not even that good at it. I'm not
05:55 

05:55 even that good at I just use Canva. M
05:59 

05:59 >> then would you say like if you abstract
06:01 

06:01 that like what level higher like they
06:03 

06:03 see you as like a creative
06:09 

06:09 >> actually when you said expected to one
06:11 

06:11 level higher I think it is more about
06:13 

06:13 like maybe I'm more resourceful like I
06:16 

06:16 get things all these small small things
06:17 

06:17 done for them
06:18 

06:18 >> like they have the main idea like like a
06:21 

06:21 mom has her her b her jewelry business
06:23 

06:23 so I'll get
06:24 

06:24 >> like her Instagram set up create some
06:27 

06:27 posters for our events for my sister
06:30 

06:30 like invite hearts for
06:35 

06:35 >> I I see you as like a resourceful and
06:38 

06:38 reliable person as well and if I needed
06:40 

06:40 anything I will ask you like when it
06:41 

06:41 comes to say like you know when we
06:43 

06:43 started um this uh app review series
06:46 

06:46 like you were the one who figured out
06:47 

06:47 like streamyard and like the logistics
06:49 

06:49 of it. Yeah. And then like even for
06:52 

06:52 women like all the events and stuff like
06:55 

06:55 that like you are always like the person
06:57 

06:57 who has all the resources
06:60 

06:60 that's your personal brand. Wait, but
07:02 

07:02 you can't just like put it on your web
07:04 

07:04 following. I am salon a resourceful.
07:07 

07:07 >> Ask me anything.
07:09 

07:09 >> Ask me anything and I will get you. Ask
07:11 

07:11 me anything actually.
07:13 

07:13 >> Sony GPT
07:16 

07:16 >> GPT
07:18 

07:18 but I do have like a five to 10 day lag.
07:21 

07:21 Uh that's when you can answer.
07:25 

07:25 >> Okay. Server uh is processing. It's
07:28 

07:28 fine.
07:30 

07:30 >> Okay. So that those such interesting
07:33 

07:33 tidbits of information to really like
07:35 

07:35 think about as you know I explore my
07:37 

07:37 personal brand and I think for a lot of
07:38 

07:38 people in the audience as well you know
07:41 

07:41 as uh because your personal brand is
07:43 

07:43 it's not like um just because you're a
07:46 

07:46 content creator or whatsoever. It's also
07:47 

07:47 like how do you put yourself forward
07:49 

07:49 when you introduce yourself to other
07:51 

07:51 people such as tech recruiters such as
07:53 

07:53 other people in the community whether
07:55 

07:55 you're a techie or a non- techie like
07:57 

07:57 what is the first thing that you want
07:59 

07:59 people to know you for you know like do
08:01 

08:01 you introduce yourself as a software
08:03 

08:03 engineer or do you introduce yourself as
08:05 

08:05 a tech community lead or do you
08:07 

08:07 introduce yourself by your values like I
08:09 

08:09 I am um like an explorer I'm somebody
08:12 

08:12 who's very resourceful like these are
08:14 

08:14 things that you have to think about sort
08:16 

08:16 of like an elev pitch for yourself and
08:20 

08:20 um it's also a constant iteration like I
08:23 

08:23 thought like being a soft like this this
08:26 

08:26 uh dialogue box was different like a
08:28 

08:28 year ago and then I changed it along the
08:31 

08:31 way my LinkedIn bio is constantly
08:33 

08:33 changing my my social media different
08:36 

08:36 bio is constantly changing as well like
08:38 

08:38 I said the latest one is social
08:40 

08:40 experiment um but yeah I think the idea
08:44 

08:44 of like personal brand, you know, and
08:48 

08:48 it's it's really interesting and very
08:51 

08:51 relevant. Um, and really combining that
08:55 

08:55 with like the idea of optimization,
08:58 

08:58 search, be it search engine optimization
09:00 

09:00 or optimizing for like the audience that
09:03 

09:03 you're trying to pitch to, be it a tech
09:05 

09:05 recruiter, be it like a networking
09:07 

09:07 event. Yeah, I think all those things
09:10 

09:10 are really great things to think about
09:12 

09:12 and I feel like I I need I need to think
09:15 

09:15 about it more for sure.
09:18 

09:18 Yeah, but thank you so much for like the
09:20 

09:20 feedback. I will work on it as I uh work
09:24 

09:24 on part two of uh this other than tech
09:27 

09:27 block. H the last part of my web folio
09:29 

09:29 is a link tree kind of thing and I
09:32 

09:32 wanted it to look like game buttons. So
09:35 

09:35 yeah. Um
09:36 

09:36 >> so cute.
09:37 

09:37 >> Yeah. And then like I put a little
09:39 

09:39 rectac here, stuff like that. And then
09:43 

09:43 these just link to like like different
09:46 

09:46 socials. Social social experiment and
09:48 

09:48 software engineer as you can see.
09:51 

09:51 >> Now I get it.
09:53 

09:53 >> And
09:55 

09:55 now this is our own link tree. Um
09:58 

09:58 audience members like please go on here
10:01 

10:01 if you have found us on YouTube or you
10:02 

10:02 have found us on like Instagram or
10:04 

10:04 whatsoever. We are on a lot of different
10:06 

10:06 platforms. um based on like your viewing
10:09 

10:09 and listening preferences. So we have
10:12 

10:12 like a little link tree. You can use our
10:14 

10:14 handle rectac or I mean if you want you
10:18 

10:18 can go to mine and then do it the long
10:19 

10:19 way around. Come to my thing and then
10:21 

10:21 click it here I guess.
10:24 

10:24 But yeah that was basically like my app
10:28 

10:28 and I guess like the the code base. Um I
10:32 

10:32 am trying to like practice what I preach
10:35 

10:35 which is like I keep telling people yeah
10:37 

10:37 I should go ahead and share it to the
10:38 

10:38 world and then like here I am in a
10:39 

10:39 private mono repository right it's so
10:41 

10:41 stupid. So I I really do want to like
10:46 

10:46 split this up into little modules and
10:48 

10:48 then you know have it across like my
10:51 

10:51 GitHub repository. I think my GitHub
10:52 

10:52 repository honestly is pretty barren
10:54 

10:54 because um like working in my
10:56 

10:56 organization a lot of projects that I
10:58 

10:58 work with are confidential. So, I didn't
10:60 

11:00 really have a lot of stuff there. Um,
11:02 

11:02 but now I kind of like want to make
11:04 

11:04 things like more public and open. So,
11:07 

11:07 yeah, I'm probably going to start like
11:10 

11:10 um uh kind of consolidating like the
11:14 

11:14 various packages and seeing if I can
11:15 

11:15 make that individual repositories that
11:17 

11:17 other people can see. But it's going to
11:20 

11:20 be a lot of work. Oh, refactoring. Oh,
11:23 

11:23 but Salony loves
11:26 

11:26 >> it. It'll pay off also because as a
11:29 

11:29 software developer your snow brand as a
11:32 

11:32 software developer comes on GitHub where
11:34 

11:34 you can see how many projects you have
11:36 

11:36 published how many opensource projects
11:39 

11:39 you have out there
11:40 

11:40 >> and how many people actually using your
11:42 

11:42 libraries that you have created.
11:45 

11:45 >> Yeah. Really?
11:48 

11:48 >> Yeah. Even all these like green dots on
11:51 

11:51 your GitHub, it actually is a flex. So
11:54 

11:54 >> that's true. But don't do the
11:57 

11:57 >> I had like a colleague who wasn't very
11:60 

11:60 technical but he was very clever. He
12:03 

12:03 knew about this whole thing uh the the
12:05 

12:05 flex of the GitHub green box. He would
12:09 

12:09 make changes in the readme every single
12:12 

12:12 day and commit it. It would be simple
12:15 

12:15 things like putting an end, putting a
12:17 

12:17 full stop, writing a new paragraph. But
12:19 

12:19 then his like entire contribution
12:21 

12:21 history looks great and he used this to
12:24 

12:24 like lie to like senior management and I
12:28 

12:28 was just like oh my gosh so con but also
12:31 

12:31 like I mean if you really want to go
12:33 

12:33 down to the level sure whatever but yeah
12:35 

12:35 >> I mean it's easy to figure out as well I
12:38 

12:38 guess
12:39 

12:39 >> uh unfortunately
12:41 

12:41 >> smart so uh
12:45 

12:45 >> but yeah I think I'll work on that and
12:48 

12:48 my My inspo shall be our dear low
12:51 

12:51 Victoria. Did you guys know Victoria is
12:54 

12:54 a GitHub star?
12:56 

12:56 >> Yes, we have among us.
12:60 

12:60 >> Oh.
13:01 

13:01 >> Oh, Victoria low. Sorry. Victoria dash
13:03 

13:03 low for GitHub.
13:07 

13:07 >> Cuz I actually wanted that domain, but
13:09 

13:09 then uh
13:11 

13:11 >> Oh, is like you went on and then you
13:15 

13:15 went to search, right?
13:16 

13:16 >> Yeah. But it's
13:17 

13:17 >> for everybody whenever I start like a
13:19 

13:19 new project I don't and I don't know
13:21 

13:21 what to name it, I always go on like
13:23 

13:23 okay you can use whatever domain name
13:25 

13:25 searcher you want but I always search it
13:27 

13:27 up the domain name first to check that
13:28 

13:28 it's available. So like I guess you were
13:32 

13:32 saying Victoria Lo is taken.
13:34 

13:34 >> Yeah. Let's see now. It's been a while
13:36 

13:36 since I checked.
13:40 

13:40 >> Oh is taken. You wanted right? Yeah,
13:44 

13:44 it's more classic or io is also fine,
13:47 

13:47 but I couldn't find
13:49 

13:49 >> Yeah. But yes, like this is a tip for
13:52 

13:52 people out there. If you're you have
13:54 

13:54 you're creating something new um and you
13:56 

13:56 don't know like um what you want to like
13:60 

13:60 uh if if you're not confident of your
14:01 

14:01 the name yet, run it through like
14:04 

14:04 various like uh domain name providers
14:06 

14:06 like GoDaddy to check if like the name
14:08 

14:08 is available. If it's not available,
14:11 

14:11 then you'll be forced through like the
14:12 

14:12 whole process of like iterating through
14:14 

14:14 different uh variations. Like in
14:16 

14:16 Victoria's case, she had to do like low
14:18 

14:18 Victoria.
14:20 

14:20 >> Yeah. But yeah.
14:22 

14:22 >> Yes. But yeah, our dear Victoria is a
14:25 

14:25 GitHub star. Do you want to explain what
14:27 

14:27 a GitHub store is?
14:29 

14:29 >> Uh so a GitHub star is basically an
14:31 

14:31 award given to uh about 100
14:34 

14:34 technologists. Uh it's basically for
14:37 

14:37 those who have contributed to the
14:39 

14:39 community. So they're usually creators
14:41 

14:41 or community contributors. For me, I was
14:43 

14:43 kind of lucky to be honest. Um if you
14:46 

14:46 see me with other GitHub stars, I'm like
14:48 

14:48 not super like, you know, open- source
14:51 

14:51 contributor like things like that. But
14:52 

14:52 it's more like they gave me the award
14:54 

14:54 because I contributed in like
14:56 

14:56 communities instead. So there's many
14:58 

14:58 different ways you can contribute to
14:60 

14:60 communities. You can do it through like
15:02 

15:02 you know organizing events or even for
15:05 

15:05 me tech blogging was considered a
15:07 

15:07 community contribution cuz I was sharing
15:09 

15:09 knowledge with people. So things like
15:11 

15:11 that you can always do any or even
15:13 

15:13 create an open source project that's
15:15 

15:15 even better actually. So that is why I
15:18 

15:18 got the GitHub star.
15:20 

15:20 >> But honestly, I got it through luck. So
15:22 

15:22 it it's not really uh but yeah, I would
15:25 

15:25 say I'm honored to get it and yeah, I'm
15:28 

15:28 just working on just do continue doing
15:30 

15:30 what I love. Like I I didn't even expect
15:32 

15:32 getting it. I remember I was nominated
15:34 

15:34 for it. So you had to be nominated to
15:36 

15:36 win this award. Um and I don't know who
15:39 

15:39 nominated me. It's all anonymous, but I
15:41 

15:41 know there were two people who nominated
15:43 

15:43 me for two years in a row. So I was
15:45 

15:45 nominated two years in a row and then on
15:48 

15:48 the second year I I won the award. So So
15:51 

15:51 yeah, it it was a it was a really good
15:54 

15:54 um uh surprise for me at least when I
15:57 

15:57 got the email like I couldn't believe
15:58 

15:58 it. So
15:60 

15:60 >> Oh, that's so cool. So it was completely
16:02 

16:02 like whoa what happened kind of thing.
16:04 

16:04 >> Just just suddenly I got the email
16:06 

16:06 saying oh you've been awarded then like
16:08 

16:08 oh really like what did I do? I didn't
16:11 

16:11 think I contribute that much, right?
16:13 

16:13 Like all I did was like write articles
16:15 

16:15 and organize some events, but I didn't
16:17 

16:17 >> I love that they recognized that as like
16:19 

16:19 contribution uh rather than just only
16:21 

16:21 recognizing code because like a big part
16:23 

16:23 of like uh code repos online code
16:25 

16:25 repositories like GitHub, it's sharing
16:27 

16:27 knowledge in general and a lot of that
16:29 

16:29 knowledge is like uh uh guides written
16:32 

16:32 in pure markdown like guides to
16:34 

16:34 typescript and documentation you know
16:37 

16:37 it's a huge part of that. I mean in in
16:40 

16:40 in a sense the documentation is also a
16:42 

16:42 lot of what parts like open AI like like
16:45 

16:45 um your co-pilot platforms if we were to
16:47 

16:47 go back to the topic that uh we were
16:49 

16:49 talking about in the last episode with
16:51 

16:51 Salomon's app um where you know it's
16:54 

16:54 true um parsing through this
16:57 

16:57 documentation and then training the
16:59 

16:59 model that they're able to correlate
17:00 

17:00 code and like um prompts words. So yeah,
17:05 

17:05 I love that they recognized you and it's
17:07 

17:07 so cool that you're one of two like
17:09 

17:09 GitHub stars in Singapore. There's
17:10 

17:10 really only two in Singapore and you're
17:12 

17:12 one of them and we are so proud of you.
17:16 

17:16 >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think like um we've
17:19 

17:19 talked quite uh a lot like in this
17:21 

17:21 episode so far. Um we've talked a lot
17:24 

17:24 about like personal branding. We talked
17:26 

17:26 about um side projects for example and
17:29 

17:29 how personal portfolios um you can
17:31 

17:31 really like be creative with it. It's
17:33 

17:33 really to showcase your individuality.
17:35 

17:35 It doesn't have to be like a to-do list
17:37 

17:37 app or like a weather app. Um, and I
17:40 

17:40 think in the process you've also found
17:41 

17:41 out more about like tech blogging and uh
17:44 

17:44 the idea of search engine optimization
17:47 

17:47 which is uh definitely like not
17:49 

17:49 something small to overlook. It's quite
17:51 

17:51 an important concept to grasp uh both in
17:54 

17:54 the industry be it if you're uh in tech
17:57 

17:57 or you're if you're doing sales, you're
17:59 

17:59 doing content creation. Um, and I guess
18:02 

18:02 you also got to know like a little bit
18:04 

18:04 about each of us. Yeah, you got to know
18:06 

18:06 a lot about us alone in the last episode
18:08 

18:08 and in this episode like got to know
18:10 

18:10 more about like Victoria and myself. Um,
18:13 

18:13 so yeah, I that that was fun. Thanks for
18:16 

18:16 the feedback, my friends.
18:19 

18:19 Thanks. And really thanks for showing us
18:21 

18:21 your website. I think it's really it
18:23 

18:23 really showcases who you are. Again, I
18:25 

18:25 know I said it many times, but I like
18:26 

18:26 the individuality. I like the
18:28 

18:28 creativity. like it's something that I I
18:31 

18:31 would say most people don't dabble in
18:33 

18:33 enough just because they always use
18:35 

18:35 they're used to boiler plates and you
18:37 

18:37 know like templates after templates. So
18:39 

18:39 it's good to see like you're really like
18:41 

18:41 just doing everything the way you like
18:43 

18:43 it making it look like a game making it
18:45 

18:45 look like Harvest Moon which is like
18:47 

18:47 really it's part of your identity. So I
18:49 

18:49 really like that. So thanks for
18:51 

18:51 showcasing us this. I think I'm
18:53 

18:53 definitely inspired by you even more
18:56 

18:56 after seeing what you have built. So
18:59 

18:59 yeah,
19:00 

19:00 >> very refreshing.
19:02 

19:02 >> Thank you. Oh yeah, and in line with
19:04 

19:04 like a recent real that Salon posted uh
19:07 

19:07 that was about how we shouldn't be
19:08 

19:08 fearing AI as developers. I think this
19:11 

19:11 is also a good example to show that like
19:13 

19:13 you know AI won't be able to produce the
19:15 

19:15 AI. It's a lot about boiler plates about
19:17 

19:17 like things that have been done before
19:19 

19:19 but your value proposition as somebody
19:23 

19:23 in tech doesn't just lie in what AI can
19:25 

19:25 already do. um you have a lot of avenues
19:27 

19:27 to showcase that creativity and uh while
19:30 

19:30 AI chooses the most efficient way out
19:32 

19:32 sometimes you don't need to choose the
19:34 

19:34 most efficient way out uh uh in order to
19:36 

19:36 learn like for example for me I chose to
19:38 

19:38 do something very low level uh and
19:41 

19:41 prioritize uh my learning over other
19:43 

19:43 things. So I thought that was like a
19:45 

19:45 good connection to like the recent posts
19:48 

19:48 that uh we've also been doing little
19:50 

19:50 shorts to share tidbits of information.
19:53 

19:53 So do check out like our links like
19:56 

19:56 here. Um we post uh short form content
20:00 

20:00 in the form of like real uh on our
20:03 

20:03 Instagram and then we also have long
20:05 

20:05 form content like this um on our YouTube
20:08 

20:08 and across our various podcast channels.
20:12

20:15

20:16 

20:16 our platforms. And yeah, show us all
20:19
