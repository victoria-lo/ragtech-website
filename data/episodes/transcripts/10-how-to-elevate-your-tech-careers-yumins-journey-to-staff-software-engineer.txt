00:00 the place
00:01 

00:01 for the last time I said the place where
00:04 

00:04 B no biting
00:07 

00:07 [Music]
00:10 

00:10 here welcome to R Tech the place for
00:13 

00:13 bites and banter I'm Salon a software
00:16 

00:16 engineer I'm Victoria Solutions engineer
00:20 

00:20 and today our guest speaker we have
00:22 

00:22 human she's a staff software engineer
00:25 

00:25 and today's topic is actually about
00:27 

00:27 human's career Journey as a software
00:29 

00:29 engineer uh so let's start off with like
00:31 

00:31 staff software engineer we have heard
00:33 

00:33 about software engineer senior software
00:35 

00:35 engineer what is Staff software engineer
00:37 

00:37 you mean yeah sometimes I ask myself the
00:39 

00:39 same question but I do think about my
00:42 

00:42 time as a software engineer then
00:45 

00:45 becoming a senior software engineer then
00:47 

00:47 a staff software engineer and I think as
00:49 

00:49 a software engineer senior software
00:50 

00:50 engineer a lot of it is about your
00:52 

00:52 individual contributions so even in the
00:55 

00:55 industry they term it as individual
00:56 

00:56 contributors so you might hear you know
00:58 

00:58 staff IC senior IC versus an engineering
01:02 

01:02 manager which is like staff em or senior
01:04 

01:04 em um the difference that I saw from
01:06 

01:06 senior to staff is more about the value
01:10 

01:10 multiplier portion how are you a value
01:13 

01:13 multiplier not just for your team but
01:15 

01:15 outside of your team in your
01:17 

01:17 organization in the engineering
01:19 

01:19 department or you know beyond it's more
01:21 

01:21 about cross team collaboration uh cross
01:24 

01:24 function collaboration and ensuring that
01:27 

01:27 the projects that you're working on the
01:28 

01:28 products that you're building is more
01:30 

01:30 more well-rounded so you're not thinking
01:32 

01:32 so much about you know okay let me just
01:34 

01:34 make sure that I get this piece um
01:36 

01:36 shipped this feature shipped it's about
01:38 

01:38 unblocking folks what parts of our
01:41 

01:41 processes can we make easier and more
01:44 

01:44 streamlined such that your team members
01:47 

01:47 or folks outside your team can do their
01:49 

01:49 jobs better um it could also be more
01:52 

01:52 focused on availability scalability
01:55 

01:55 extensibility everything about you know
01:56 

01:56 the engineering aspects and making sure
01:58 

01:58 that it's built in a way that's stable
02:02 

02:02 um especially when you are working for a
02:04 

02:04 company that's servicing hundreds of
02:06 

02:06 millions of uh users that becomes very
02:09 

02:09 important you have this promise to them
02:11 

02:11 that you have availability being
02:14 

02:14 99.999% the 59 as they talk about yeah
02:17 

02:17 so your your job is now more expanded in
02:21 

02:21 impact and scope wow that's amazing so
02:25 

02:25 from what I'm hearing is there's a lot
02:27 

02:27 of communication involved as well so it
02:29 

02:29 seems like a
02:30 

02:30 a challenging both in communication as
02:33 

02:33 well as technical aspect so yeah we're
02:36 

02:36 very curious like um your Tech Journey
02:38 

02:38 because of this like how did you uh how
02:41 

02:41 did you get into Tech and maybe start
02:43 

02:43 from your childhood days and uh what
02:47 

02:47 what made you want to be a software
02:49 

02:49 engineer yeah great question um I think
02:53 

02:53 you know most of my childhood I didn't
02:55 

02:55 it was more of
02:56 

02:56 like getting through the education
02:58 

02:58 system I was born and raised in
02:60 

02:60 Singapore went through the education in
03:01 

03:01 Singapore I think both of you
03:03 

03:03 similarly and you know it's a lot about
03:07 

03:07 going through the rhythms until you are
03:09 

03:09 done with a levels and then I was like
03:12 

03:12 what now you know I held a bunch of odd
03:14 

03:14 jobs I was you know at one point a
03:16 

03:16 waitress at Baker z um I was even
03:20 

03:20 helping out the the air show and I just
03:22 

03:22 didn't know what to do and so I asked my
03:25 

03:25 parents like hey do you have any advice
03:26 

03:26 for me and they're both actually
03:28 

03:28 engineers and sometimes joke about maybe
03:31 

03:31 my mom whispered into my you want to be
03:33 

03:33 an engineer at night and somehow I felt
03:36 

03:36 like okay I'll give it a shot it seems
03:38 

03:38 generic enough that you know you can
03:39 

03:39 figure out do you want to be a chemical
03:41 

03:41 engineer civil engineer software
03:43 

03:43 engineer um so I just applied for
03:45 

03:45 schools and I think I also wanted um
03:49 

03:49 some experience overseas I was very
03:51 

03:51 lucky and privileged that my parents
03:52 

03:52 were able to you know support that and
03:55 

03:55 my mom was also like ready for me to fly
03:57 

03:57 out of the nest right um and so I gave
04:00 

04:00 it a shot I went to Carnegie melon
04:02 

04:02 University I did a general degree at
04:05 

04:05 first like you know in your first year
04:06 

04:06 you can kind of figure it out so you
04:09 

04:09 would take one type of engineering the
04:11 

04:11 first half of the year the first
04:12 

04:12 semester and then try something else the
04:15 

04:15 second semester so I did software
04:17 

04:17 engineering and I also tried out uh I
04:19 

04:19 think it was civil engineering I don't
04:20 

04:20 really remember now because I fell in
04:22 

04:22 love with the software site that I never
04:23 

04:23 looked back uh actually I went into
04:25 

04:25 electrical and computer engineering so
04:28 

04:28 both software and hardware and um
04:30 

04:30 I just fell in love with like the
04:32 

04:32 problem solving and since young my mom
04:34 

04:34 always told me no I would fold origami
04:36 

04:36 and I would have all them lined up on
04:38 

04:38 the shelf and she's like she collecting
04:39 

04:39 dust and I was like but it looks you
04:41 

04:41 know I had to make sure that it fits
04:43 

04:43 nicely the line is straight um and to me
04:46 

04:46 it was like a mathematical problem that
04:48 

04:48 you're solving in a way and I also found
04:50 

04:50 myself drawn to like knitting to
04:52 

04:52 crocheting where you had to think about
04:54 

04:54 numbers as well and The Logical like
04:56 

04:56 okay if you add two more stitches it's
04:58 

04:58 going to become bigger and bigger you it
04:59 

04:59 becomes a ccle or something so I knew I
05:02 

05:02 I I had the uh propensity to work on
05:04 

05:04 something that was you know problem
05:07 

05:07 solving and what what better place to do
05:09 

05:09 it than you know I think Engineering
05:10 

05:10 also and um I was strong in math I was
05:13 

05:13 strong in most Sciences physics I was
05:16 

05:16 terrible at so I don't really know where
05:18 

05:18 that fell but um it was good enough it
05:20 

05:20 was good enough to at least try my hand
05:22 

05:22 in software engineering and I think what
05:25 

05:25 solidified it for me was my very first
05:28 

05:28 um course Java Java 101 it was I think
05:31 

05:31 intro to Computer Engineering and at
05:34 

05:34 carnegi melon everybody had to go
05:35 

05:35 through it except for I think um in the
05:38 

05:38 drama school and the architecture school
05:40 

05:40 I think everybody else had to go through
05:42 

05:42 uh intro Computing 101 oh interesting it
05:45 

05:45 was Java programming and not some other
05:48 

05:48 programing language like python or
05:50 

05:50 JavaScript yeah and I think it's because
05:52 

05:52 Python's like you know U more for
05:54 

05:54 scripting or whereas Java you could you
05:57 

05:57 know they we had this framework it's
05:59 

05:59 called Dr Java that we used back then
06:01 

06:01 it's like very long ago I'm not going to
06:02 

06:02 say how many years um but at least you
06:04 

06:04 could you know use there was this a
06:07 

06:07 plug-in that you could use to visualize
06:10 

06:10 your work so Java I mean intro to
06:13 

06:13 computer 101 I remember it was very much
06:15 

06:15 like building games so I built Tetris I
06:18 

06:18 built snake I built um that's why I
06:21 

06:21 learned about for Loops you know and W
06:23 

06:23 it really blew my mind how far behind I
06:25 

06:25 was compared to my American like peers
06:29 

06:29 like they all had some form of computing
06:31 

06:31 background in high school yeah so for
06:34 

06:34 Loops to me was a struggle and I was
06:35 

06:35 like I don't know if I can do this
06:37 

06:37 because I was stuck on four Loops but
06:39 

06:39 you look back now you're like that's
06:40 

06:40 just you know already muscle memory
06:43 

06:43 right um but yeah when I saw like Tetris
06:46 

06:46 you know you built the blocks and you
06:48 

06:48 take for granted when you're playing the
06:49 

06:49 game but when you think about like all
06:51 

06:51 the things that have to happen okay
06:52 

06:52 making sure that you're within the
06:53 

06:53 boundaries and not having like an
06:55 

06:55 overflow issue um making sure that you
06:59 

06:59 can make those animations right when you
07:01 

07:01 when you first form a row and then the
07:03 

07:03 block like just explodes or something
07:05 

07:05 things like that and it's like oh you
07:07 

07:07 want to think about the angle at which
07:09 

07:09 the the little blocks explode into so a
07:11 

07:11 part of it was math involved as well and
07:13 

07:13 I think it was great in marrying all
07:16 

07:16 these different concepts right the for
07:18 

07:18 Loops whatever we talked about the
07:19 

07:19 boundaries making sure that you're um
07:22 

07:22 type checking or making sure that you
07:24 

07:24 are accounting for the edge cases like
07:26 

07:26 literally the edge cases right um and
07:29 

07:29 then also being to see your work the the
07:32 

07:32 visual feedback was very important
07:33 

07:33 because the feedback loop is how you
07:36 

07:36 iterate quickly which I think is quite
07:39 

07:39 fundamental to software engineering
07:40 

07:40 today right yeah wow so basically from
07:44 

07:44 what I hear is that you're born to be an
07:46 

07:46 engineer like since young with the
07:48 

07:48 origami with just even crocheting I was
07:51 

07:51 quite surprised it's just me trying to
07:53 

07:53 find some common ground with you but I
07:55 

07:55 also crochet yeah see yeah yeah cuz I do
07:57 

07:57 find like it's really just fun to build
07:59 

07:59 things just the design part of it so the
08:02 

08:02 fact that you did all this when you were
08:04 

08:04 young I think you're just born to be an
08:06 

08:06 engineer you always love problem solving
08:08 

08:08 building designing Solutions I think
08:11 

08:11 that's something that is really
08:13 

08:13 admirable about you is that thank you so
08:15 

08:15 much that whatever you want to do you
08:17 

08:17 just pursue it and you fell in love with
08:19 

08:19 software engineering which I think
08:21 

08:21 that's really great um you also
08:23 

08:23 mentioned how your peers back then um
08:25 

08:25 have Computing background whereas you
08:27 

08:27 did not um I want to ask because I think
08:30 

08:30 impostor syndrome is something a lot of
08:32 

08:32 developers have to deal with day to day
08:35 

08:35 how did you actually overcome that when
08:36 

08:36 you feel like oh I'm falling behind yeah
08:39 

08:39 what was your mindset like you know in
08:41 

08:41 order to actually learn and then I see
08:44 

08:44 how you're so positive about oh four
08:45 

08:45 Loops is okay like you know over time
08:47 

08:47 you learn so I'm just curious about how
08:49 

08:49 you overcome that yeah um I'll be honest
08:52 

08:52 I haven't been this positive like all my
08:55 

08:55 life right it's it's based on the callus
08:58 

08:58 that you built going through the ups and
09:01 

09:01 downs if I recall correctly I mean it's
09:03 

09:03 been a while but I do remember feeling
09:06 

09:06 like I was falling behind and then
09:08 

09:08 realizing that I could tell myself that
09:10 

09:10 I'm you can constantly tell yourself
09:12 

09:12 like I'm behind I'm behind but you have
09:14 

09:14 to do something about it right and so I
09:16 

09:16 think I really leaned on my professors I
09:18 

09:18 leaned on my other peers who were very
09:20 

09:20 very helpful who had the experience so
09:23 

09:23 thinking about who can I tap on like
09:26 

09:26 into to help me you know progress I do
09:30 

09:30 recognize um what I'm falling short on
09:33 

09:33 recognize that and acknowledging that is
09:35 

09:35 I think the first step to you know
09:37 

09:37 progressing um then you have to figure
09:39 

09:39 out what your resources are at hand and
09:42 

09:42 I think back then we didn't really have
09:44 

09:44 like oh you know Tik Tok or like um
09:46 

09:46 stack Overflow as available to us so
09:49 

09:49 it's really about connecting with the
09:51 

09:51 folks that you know um so yeah a lot of
09:55 

09:55 my peers that I would lean into as my
09:57 

09:57 tribe and a lot of them were very
09:58 

09:58 encouraging and tell telling me like you
09:60 

09:60 know it's okay like you have to start
10:01 

10:01 somewhere not everybody you know I mean
10:04 

10:04 they had to start from somewhere as well
10:06 

10:06 and knowing that they can progress to
10:08 

10:08 where they are today by putting in the
10:09 

10:09 work I can do that too right and so like
10:12 

10:12 I never believe in the whole like um you
10:15 

10:15 know I'm I'm too stupid to figure this
10:17 

10:17 out or or I'm you know not good enough
10:20 

10:20 it's more about I just haven't been
10:22 

10:22 exposed to it uh I have now the you know
10:26 

10:26 a wealth of resources at hand in college
10:29 

10:29 especially like I have professors the
10:30 

10:30 students who went through it um other
10:32 

10:32 like seniors in the program so I think
10:35 

10:35 it was more about getting being okay
10:38 

10:38 asking for help and and knowing how to
10:41 

10:41 ask for the help because I can't be like
10:43 

10:43 oh I don't know how to do for Loops I
10:44 

10:44 mean okay that's very specific but I
10:45 

10:45 don't know how to program then they
10:47 

10:47 going to be like what about programming
10:49 

10:49 that you not don't know like let's start
10:50 

10:50 small and you know it's overwhelming
10:53 

10:53 when you want to take a very big step
10:56 

10:56 but if you break it down to smaller
10:57 

10:57 steps also another part of I think
10:59 

10:59 engineering very fundamental is breaking
11:02 

11:02 down a big thing a big problem into
11:05 

11:05 smaller chunks that's more digestible
11:07 

11:07 and try to parallelize that work too
11:09 

11:09 right um so yeah I think back then I
11:12 

11:12 wish I could tell myself that hey it's
11:13 

11:13 good you're good you you you overcome
11:15 

11:15 this but I remember thinking like it was
11:17 

11:17 a struggle on top of being in Pittsburgh
11:20 

11:20 Pennsylvania where it was you know the
11:22 

11:22 Four Seasons and I remember being stuck
11:25 

11:25 in the snow and you know missing home
11:28 

11:28 and then having to you understand that
11:31 

11:31 okay this is what I'm going through but
11:33 

11:33 I'm also here to learn and my parents
11:35 

11:35 you know support that and so I cannot
11:38 

11:38 waste time I cannot waste this
11:40 

11:40 opportunity to um make use of the
11:43 

11:43 resources that I have now yeah and also
11:46 

11:46 like I mean there's no other way you're
11:48 

11:48 going to go get through the class
11:50 

11:50 without putting in the work so I think
11:52 

11:52 that was also a forcing function and the
11:54 

11:54 professor was very good about the
11:57 

11:57 problem sets that we had to do and to
11:59 

11:59 slowly bu the foundation yeah yeah I
12:02 

12:02 think that's very inspiring like just
12:04 

12:04 from you recognizing that this is an
12:06 

12:06 opportunity and you don't want to waste
12:08 

12:08 that chance it's I think that's
12:09 

12:09 something that a lot of people may or
12:12 

12:12 may not take for granted but the fact
12:15 

12:15 that you still want to persevere and do
12:17 

12:17 that that shows a lot of your strong
12:18 

12:18 character right thank you that's why I'm
12:21 

12:21 actually I remember when we first met
12:23 

12:23 I'm like a lot of things that you say it
12:25 

12:25 really resonates to me not only that it
12:27 

12:27 inspires me to do better just because
12:30 

12:30 you're
12:31 

12:31 really yeah just because you're not only
12:34 

12:34 genuine in helping others but you are
12:36 

12:36 also very comfortable in seeking help I
12:38 

12:38 think a lot of developers might feel
12:40 

12:40 like this is a lone journey and that
12:42 

12:42 seeking help is not something they're
12:44 

12:44 very comfortable with it's hard to be
12:46 

12:46 vulnerable it's hard to admit what you
12:48 

12:48 don't know right yeah so I think just
12:50 

12:50 seeking help is very an an under rated
12:54 

12:54 skill you have I agree I agree I like
12:56 

12:56 the part where you said like break it
12:58 

12:58 down to smaller smaller chunks I was
12:60 

12:60 like divide and concer yeah that's where
13:03 

13:03 it all comes from your algorithm is
13:05 

13:05 really like how do I parallelize this as
13:08 

13:08 a student you have to you know use that
13:10 

13:10 algorithm already so okay let's uh let's
13:14 

13:14 move on to like internships and like
13:17 

13:17 right after your college uh your
13:19 

13:19 University how did you progress on from
13:22 

13:22 there like how easy was it to get a job
13:24 

13:24 yeah um I say that I was maybe a year or
13:28 

13:28 two a little late in my my search like
13:30 

13:30 internship search you know I had some
13:33 

13:33 classmates who are more gangho and sorry
13:36 

13:36 can we Define what gangho means like um
13:38 

13:38 overachieving maybe overachieving maybe
13:40 

13:40 overachieving might that would be the
13:42 

13:42 closest a good way overachieving in a
13:44 

13:44 good way I mean is it never a bad way
13:46 

13:46 but um anyway like I felt like I was
13:48 

13:48 lagging behind because I didn't actually
13:51 

13:51 put in the effort to find an internship
13:54 

13:54 till maybe the third year so like junior
13:56 

13:56 year and um a lot of my years were
13:60 

13:60 already like internship in freshman
14:02 

14:02 sophomore year already but I think it
14:04 

14:04 was slightly harder for a non-american
14:07 

14:07 because a lot of the internships or
14:09 

14:09 companies they only will offer you an
14:11 

14:11 internship if you have uh our US citizen
14:14 

14:14 or us green card holder and I was
14:16 

14:16 neither of those I had a student visa so
14:19 

14:19 if like you know the pool of companies I
14:21 

14:21 could apply to just shrunk right and um
14:25 

14:25 I also didn't feel prepared because my
14:27 

14:27 foundations I felt needed work
14:30 

14:30 I didn't know if I could you know go
14:32 

14:32 into the real world and you know have a
14:35 

14:35 shaky Foundation while trying to do the
14:38 

14:38 the soft skill side of communicating
14:39 

14:39 working with project managers working
14:41 

14:41 with like you know the engineering
14:43 

14:43 manager and other folks on the team um
14:46 

14:46 University or like college is just you
14:49 

14:49 are very tightly scoped you have maybe
14:51 

14:51 two three three or four um teammates
14:53 

14:53 working on a project together and the
14:54 

14:54 tests are the test that you write right
14:56 

14:56 it's not like
14:57 

14:57 production wide kind of t testing with
14:60 

14:60 real users so I felt that I still needed
15:03 

15:03 more honing of my skills in that well
15:05 

15:05 scoped environment before I was ready to
15:07 

15:07 Branch out and then in the third year I
15:09 

15:09 like I went for all the college fairs
15:10 

15:10 the career fairs I also made sure that
15:13 

15:13 um my extracurricular wise like I was in
15:16 

15:16 the women intact kind of society uh
15:19 

15:19 equivalent Society in at CMU I was also
15:23 

15:23 um one of the we had this thing called
15:26 

15:26 Spring Carnival at Carnegie melon and
15:29 

15:29 part of the activity is like building a
15:30 

15:30 booth like literally wooden structures
15:33 

15:33 wooden like 2x4s you know you saw saw
15:37 

15:37 their pieces together and you have to
15:38 

15:38 put up a booth based on a theme and at
15:41 

15:41 that time I was at Singapore Student
15:42 

15:42 Association for Kani Millan as well and
15:45 

15:45 I you know heard from the seniors like
15:47 

15:47 hey we used to do this thing we won I
15:49 

15:49 think third prize before in our category
15:51 

15:51 and I was like well maybe we should try
15:53 

15:53 it again I mean I'd be interested and
15:55 

15:55 then I just put myself in this position
15:56 

15:56 to beat this thing um and it was a very
15:59 

15:59 good learning experience because it
16:02 

16:02 taught me that you know like like any
16:05 

16:05 project or any product that you're
16:07 

16:07 building at work you need multiple
16:09 

16:09 disciplines right you need designers you
16:11 

16:11 need um QA or you know some Engineers
16:14 

16:14 are full stack you need the front end
16:16 

16:16 you need the back end you need the um
16:19 

16:19 product manager who's overseeing the
16:21 

16:21 whole thing and you need all the
16:22 

16:22 expertise like subject matter experts
16:24 

16:24 right when you build a booth that's
16:25 

16:25 similar you need in that person who is
16:28 

16:28 very comfortable in the electrician
16:30 

16:30 aspect like you need to wire it up your
16:32 

16:32 booth needs to like light up right you
16:34 

16:34 need the architect you need the civil
16:36 

16:36 engineer to know that if you're building
16:38 

16:38 a two-story Booth you want to make sure
16:39 

16:39 the weight holds right um or just that
16:42 

16:42 your structure doesn't fall apart uh and
16:45 

16:45 so like there were also Booth um
16:47 

16:47 meetings that we had to go to with like
16:49 

16:49 okay you need to make sure that your
16:51 

16:51 structures at least this kind of format
16:54 

16:54 your 2x4s must be at least this amount
16:57 

16:57 wide or far apart from each other
16:60 

16:60 so I was leading this thing and I felt
17:01 

17:01 that um you know it was very uh
17:03 

17:03 instrumental to being ready for working
17:06 

17:06 outside of like my comfort zone and into
17:09 

17:09 like the internship thing I digress but
17:11 

17:11 anyway that was uh instrumental and then
17:14 

17:14 having that on my resume also could help
17:16 

17:16 me stand out as well to recruiters and
17:19 

17:19 thankfully I landed an internship at a
17:21 

17:21 New York dark pool's Equity trading firm
17:25 

17:25 um this was back in yeah my uh junior
17:27 

17:27 year yeah and I had a really good
17:29 

17:29 engineering manager uh very supportive
17:32 

17:32 um but you know I think I wasn't I
17:35 

17:35 didn't really Vibe with New York I felt
17:38 

17:38 lots of Rage coming out of it like I was
17:41 

17:41 you know coming out of this train
17:43 

17:43 station you're like oh my gosh
17:44 

17:44 everyone's moving so slowly why is that
17:45 

17:45 because he always felt rushed and I just
17:47 

17:47 didn't foresee a future working in New
17:50 

17:50 York long term it just wasn't it didn't
17:52 

17:52 feel right for me but um so I didn't
17:54 

17:54 eventually go you know go there full
17:57 

17:57 time um and look for something something
17:59 

17:59 else for my full-time job but I think
18:01 

18:01 career Affairs career Affairs
18:03 

18:03 extracurricular activities joining
18:05 

18:05 societies where you can network with
18:06 

18:06 folks was I think very instrumental to
18:09 

18:09 lending it yeah well I really love
18:12 

18:12 everything you say from like finding
18:14 

18:14 your Community First in like wom who Co
18:16 

18:16 like women in Tech and then also the
18:18 

18:18 Singapore Association like finding your
18:21 

18:21 tribe I think that's very important and
18:23 

18:23 then from there you progress to actually
18:25 

18:25 building a booth like that was
18:26 

18:26 surprising how you can make the
18:27 

18:27 connection from building a booth is
18:29 

18:29 actually similar working in like an
18:31 

18:31 engineering team then every part of your
18:34 

18:34 experience kind of contributes to where
18:36 

18:36 you are today I do I do believe that
18:38 

18:38 yeah yeah so I think that's how not only
18:41 

18:41 can you make that connection but it
18:42 

18:42 actually helps build you over time um
18:45 

18:45 and it's also interesting how you
18:47 

18:47 mentioned about New York and how you
18:49 

18:49 didn't Vibe with the culture because I
18:50 

18:50 think a lot of people like at least in
18:52 

18:52 Tech they dream about living in us they
18:55 

18:55 dream about pursuing that Silicon Valley
18:57 

18:57 dream um it's is there anything maybe I
18:60 

19:00 mean this is definitely from just your
19:01 

19:01 personal experience it's it's not it
19:03 

19:03 will not apply to everyone but is there
19:05 

19:05 anything that you can share about you
19:07 

19:07 know some expectations versus reality
19:09 

19:09 cuz you know some people they don't have
19:11 

19:11 that information like what it's like
19:13 

19:13 working there what are some pros and
19:15 

19:15 cons and you know you did have a
19:19 

19:19 position in us for some time what was
19:22 

19:22 that like for you also yeah I think I
19:25 

19:25 knew I wanted to work in the US because
19:28 

19:28 of all the opportunity ities not just
19:30 

19:30 your job opportunities but also
19:33 

19:33 opportunities to meet other people from
19:35 

19:35 other walks of life other countries and
19:38 

19:38 it's always been you know diversity and
19:40 

19:40 inclusion has always been very important
19:42 

19:42 to me and I think I didn't realize how
19:44 

19:44 important it was until I left Singapore
19:47 

19:47 because I you know most of um yeah I I
19:51 

19:51 think yeah you don't know what you don't
19:53 

19:53 know right so until you've gotten to the
19:55 

19:55 other side and realized oh wow there's
19:57 

19:57 so much to learn from so many different
19:59 

19:59 people um New York New York didn't fit
20:02 

20:02 me personally because of the fast pace
20:05 

20:05 and I I'm tend to be someone who's more
20:08 

20:08 like I like to take my time to really
20:11 

20:11 understand something before I say
20:12 

20:12 something or I'm more of an observer and
20:16 

20:16 I think you know at first I was you know
20:18 

20:18 worried that I would come across as this
20:21 

20:21 person doesn't really talk like she's
20:23 

20:23 what she thinking you know and I have
20:24 

20:24 learned to show my working in work as
20:27 

20:27 well to just say hey I need a bit of
20:29 

20:29 space to just digest what went through
20:31 

20:31 what went on in the meeting and I have
20:34 

20:34 thoughts I'll come back to you on it so
20:36 

20:36 just give me some time right whereas I
20:38 

20:38 have very quick wited friends and um Co
20:41 

20:41 co-workers that are able to just very
20:43 

20:43 quickly yeah this is a good idea this is
20:44 

20:44 a bad idea this is XYZ I'm not that
20:46 

20:46 person I need time to like think through
20:48 

20:48 the different edge cases happy path that
20:51 

20:51 path whatever and then I have I can
20:53 

20:53 formulate something and I feel
20:54 

20:54 comfortable presenting to the team so I
20:56 

20:56 thought New York was more fast-paced and
20:59 

20:59 I didn't know if I could thrive in that
21:01 

21:01 environment I felt a lot of pressure a
21:04 

21:04 lot of anxiety that at that time didn't
21:07 

21:07 even know it was like what you would
21:08 

21:08 term anxiety I just felt like I couldn't
21:10 

21:10 settle and it felt very uneasy um so I
21:13 

21:13 decided like I know after 3 months was a
21:15 

21:15 good was a good gate to learn how to
21:18 

21:18 speak up to learn how to um be aware of
21:22 

21:22 my limitations but also aware of my
21:24 

21:24 strengths and then take a step back
21:26 

21:26 maybe try to explore another city um um
21:29 

21:29 and that's you know after the last year
21:31 

21:31 of college I leared a job in Chicago and
21:35 

21:35 you know Frankly Speaking I also you
21:36 

21:36 have to look at the numbers right uh New
21:38 

21:38 York's very expensive to live in if
21:40 

21:40 you're coming out of college the first
21:42 

21:42 paychecks not always the the highest
21:44 

21:44 right generally it wasn't for me and so
21:47 

21:47 I I would look at my opportunities
21:49 

21:49 Boston New York Chicago which one felt
21:51 

21:51 like the best
21:53 

21:53 financial um like Financial like
21:56 

21:56 something that made the most Financial
21:57 

21:57 sense and Chicago was it
21:59 

21:59 uh it was affordable as well and yeah I
22:02 

22:02 I knew that um you know I've never lived
22:05 

22:05 in Chicago and it was the first time I
22:06 

22:06 went to Chicago was literally for the
22:08 

22:08 interview I fell in love with the city I
22:10 

22:10 fell in love with the team most
22:12 

22:12 importantly and I knew that it was a
22:14 

22:14 company that I could grow in and I knew
22:17 

22:17 that it was a company that could
22:18 

22:18 recognize you know it the career
22:21 

22:21 opportunities that I'd be interested in
22:23 

22:23 so you have to like think about that too
22:25 

22:25 the company in Boston that I interviewed
22:27 

22:27 with great like you know but I couldn't
22:29 

22:29 buy the chemistry just wasn't right I
22:31 

22:31 couldn't I thought was too corporate for
22:33 

22:33 someone who's starting up um and then
22:36 

22:36 the one in New York again it's like just
22:38 

22:38 the the the pace of things would just
22:40 

22:40 didn't fit so Chicago felt like the best
22:42 

22:42 one and then in Chicago itself I you
22:44 

22:44 know went through um midsize firm in fin
22:48 

22:48 like Tech financial fintech um then I
22:51 

22:51 went into a startup in consumer loyalty
22:55 

22:55 space then I went to a very interesting
22:57 

22:57 like combination I think one of the
22:58 

22:58 episode talked about you know startups
22:60 

22:60 versus mang and then you know being in a
23:02 

23:02 big company but a startup I went into
23:04 

23:04 something like that um where they were
23:06 

23:06 trying to re rethink their platform um
23:10 

23:10 so more of the R&D space so we were
23:12 

23:12 startup operating with a Fortune 500
23:15 

23:15 company so I've seen like the different
23:17 

23:17 ones and then the most latest I've
23:18 

23:18 lended at is where I am working now um
23:21 

23:21 which is a you know a decent siiz
23:23 

23:23 company as well and very very Global so
23:27 

23:27 I think going through that Journey
23:29 

23:29 is part of grow like um taking the
23:32 

23:32 opportunity to grow your career and then
23:35 

23:35 at some point it switched to taking the
23:37 

23:37 opportunity to learn more about myself
23:39 

23:39 and then how do I help other people
23:42 

23:42 because I feel blessed that I was you
23:45 

23:45 know I had my tribe I had my engineering
23:48 

23:48 managers that helped I had my peers
23:50 

23:50 women other women in Engineers that
23:52 

23:52 helped me um and I think like at some
23:55 

23:55 point you got to pay it for it right and
23:58 

23:58 I think when my my career was at a spot
24:00 

24:00 where I felt good good about and I felt
24:03 

24:03 that I had enough Social Capital to
24:05 

24:05 leverage I decided that okay it's now
24:07 

24:07 time for me to not so much about let me
24:10 

24:10 go get the next um you know promotion
24:12 

24:12 and more about how do I help other
24:14 

24:14 people on my team attain that or achieve
24:16 

24:16 that and how do I push myself also out
24:19 

24:19 of the comfort zone like even doing this
24:20 

24:20 podcast is a different thing for me
24:22 

24:22 right or um going you know giving
24:25 

24:25 workshops in person that's also like uh
24:27 

24:27 don't ask my first like self from Last 5
24:30 

24:30 Years to do that it's something that I
24:33 

24:33 realized that I need to you know push
24:35 

24:35 myself out of the comfort zone and keep
24:37 

24:37 learning I mean they always say you know
24:40 

24:40 like you learn as long as you live so
24:43 

24:43 those are little things that I knew I
24:45 

24:45 could do to push and learn more and also
24:49 

24:49 network with with folks and you know I
24:51 

24:51 really have enjoyed the entire Journey
24:56 

24:56 wow yeah I actually wanted to highlight
24:58 

24:58 your part where cuz when uh when we met
25:00 

25:00 once we did you did mention that the
25:03 

25:03 women mentors in your career Journey
25:05 

25:05 were really uh like a highlight for your
25:08 

25:08 to you know move ahead in your journey I
25:11 

25:11 wanted to like learn like ask you more
25:13 

25:13 about that like how do you find such uh
25:16 

25:16 mentors are they your leads and how do
25:19 

25:19 you approach them uh how do you have
25:22 

25:22 this connection with them to allow you
25:24 

25:24 to like cuz as women in Tech uh it is a
25:28 

25:28 little it is different a different
25:31 

25:31 Journey from a male intch for sure right
25:34 

25:34 so like how's that different and yeah
25:36 

25:36 how can other women uh in Tech also yeah
25:39 

25:39 I think it's a mix
25:41 

25:41 of luck and a mix of your drive to find
25:47 

25:47 connections that you know you want to
25:48 

25:48 grow into I think it's always good to
25:51 

25:51 have a healthy balance of like you know
25:53 

25:53 mentors that are similar to you but also
25:55 

25:55 mentors that are very different from you
25:57 

25:57 just to have that you know um variety of
26:01 

26:01 perspective as for the women in my
26:04 

26:04 career I would I would start actually
26:06 

26:06 even my mom is like the the most
26:09 

26:09 inspiring person and woman that I know
26:12 

26:12 that I see her and I know like oh you
26:14 

26:14 are strong woman she was I think the
26:16 

26:16 second the first woman lecturer at um at
26:19 

26:19 one of the universities here in
26:21 

26:21 electrical Computer Engineering so you
26:23 

26:23 know to me she's a Pioneer in her field
26:26 

26:26 and back then you know in their
26:27 

26:27 generation it was a lot harder to get
26:29 

26:29 into the field into as a woman in Tech
26:32 

26:32 um so I started out with that you know
26:34 

26:34 seeing my mom as an inspiration then
26:36 

26:36 realizing that okay like I should be
26:38 

26:38 more cognizant of this um I would say in
26:42 

26:42 my earlier companies that I joined there
26:45 

26:45 weren't as many women even in college I
26:48 

26:48 was like you know um two out of out of
26:51 

26:51 maybe
26:52 

26:52 30 people in class it was women and the
26:56 

26:56 ratio was just not stacked in our favor
26:59 

26:59 um and that's why I think like I hold
27:02 

27:02 those connections dear to me like as if
27:04 

27:04 once I see them and I have that
27:06 

27:06 connection with a fellow women in Tech I
27:08 

27:08 do you know really want to make sure
27:10 

27:10 that we take care of each other and
27:12 

27:12 someone mentioned to me before like you
27:14 

27:14 you LIF as you climb like while you are
27:17 

27:17 pursuing the the so-called career letter
27:20 

27:20 whether that's you know vertically or
27:23 

27:23 horizontally make sure that you know if
27:25 

27:25 you have an opportunity to support
27:26 

27:26 another woman or someone support someone
27:30 

27:30 in the marginalized gender that you do
27:31 

27:31 that um and when I say it's a bit of
27:34 

27:34 luck it's because like I can't predict
27:36 

27:36 you know what team I end up in or what
27:39 

27:39 company what the ratio is like and uh my
27:42 

27:42 first few companies I was only the only
27:44 

27:44 woman in the team and then we with I was
27:47 

27:47 part of the interviewing panel as well
27:49 

27:49 and I saw that in the pipeline we were
27:50 

27:50 getting more and more women intact and
27:52 

27:52 that really made me like happy to see
27:54 

27:54 that because it's not only about um
27:58 

27:58 having enough women in the field it's
27:59 

27:59 also about you know the women being
28:01 

28:01 feeling comfortable enough to apply for
28:03 

28:03 that role as well and on the company
28:05 

28:05 side having an interviewing panel that
28:08 

28:08 is inclusive and cognizant of like the
28:11 

28:11 difference right um or like sorry not
28:14 

28:14 the difference but the the variety that
28:16 

28:16 we want to hire for as well and you know
28:20 

28:20 a lot of times I think
28:22 

28:22 um it's a tough tough balance um because
28:27 

28:27 you don't ever want to be like I'm a
28:29 

28:29 women uh like I'm a woman uh you should
28:31 

28:31 hire me because I'm that's never the
28:33 

28:33 case it should never be the case I am a
28:34 

28:34 good engineer I just happen to be a
28:37 

28:37 woman I just happen to be Asian or
28:39 

28:39 something like but you should hire me
28:41 

28:41 for my skill set and you know you built
28:44 

28:44 that confidence um after a while as well
28:47 

28:47 as a woman in Tech because you see other
28:49 

28:49 people doing it you see that it's
28:51 

28:51 possible right um yeah I don't know
28:54 

28:54 where I'm going with this
28:55 

28:55 actually because yeah I think yeah it's
28:58 

28:58 a mix of both um and I've been lucky to
29:02 

29:02 have very very strong badass women in
29:05 

29:05 the leadership
29:08 

29:08 positions that have helped me and
29:10 

29:10 inspired me and they've direct you know
29:13 

29:13 give directions or if I wanted to have a
29:15 

29:15 more hands hands off kind of Mentor they
29:19 

29:19 they gave me my space they would ask
29:21 

29:21 coaching questions you know but don't
29:23 

29:23 give me the answers right away or they
29:25 

29:25 would even spot opportunities for me to
29:28 

29:28 get the experience and I think that was
29:30 

29:30 really key cuz I am someone that you
29:32 

29:32 know you can tell me a 100 times the
29:34 

29:34 same thing but if I don't experience it
29:35 

29:35 myself and I think a lot of people are
29:36 

29:36 similar if you don't experience it
29:38 

29:38 yourself it's hard to really you know um
29:41 

29:41 get that in your ingrained right um so I
29:44 

29:44 need to go through the experiences the
29:46 

29:46 the the the challenges to then be okay
29:48 

29:48 like okay I've overcome this I am worthy
29:51 

29:51 of this
29:52 

29:52 opportunity um so yeah I think it's a
29:54 

29:54 mix of both yeah uh so like for the last
29:59 

29:59 question that we have for you uh wanted
30:00 

30:00 to ask you so what's next for you what
30:04 

30:04 in your journey what ST in my journey
30:06 

30:06 that's a good I am actually in the
30:08 

30:08 process of figuring that out and that's
30:10 

30:10 why I'm taking vacation to just chill
30:13 

30:13 reflect and you know I think currently
30:17 

30:17 I'm in a team where there's not a lot of
30:19 

30:19 people in APAC it's still very much uh
30:22 

30:22 majority in the
30:24 

30:24 US um position and so if I wanted to
30:27 

30:27 pursue the next thing which would be
30:29 

30:29 know as a principal engineer I also have
30:30 

30:30 to think about like the FaceTime that
30:33 

30:33 you have to show um and cuz you need to
30:36 

30:36 rally the troops when you come when it's
30:38 

30:38 about principal engineer you're now
30:39 

30:39 looking at the hardest problems you want
30:42 

30:42 to solve hardest but most important
30:44 

30:44 problems you want to solve for the
30:45 

30:45 company then you have to kind of rally
30:48 

30:48 the troops like get people to work with
30:50 

30:50 you and get behind the idea of like this
30:52 

30:52 is an important problem to Sol like how
30:54 

30:54 do we go about doing it and I don't know
30:56 

30:56 if that is currently
30:59 

30:59 like um it probably isn't the most um I
31:03 

31:03 think there'll be a lot of challenges
31:05 

31:05 with the time zone differences to Rally
31:07 

31:07 the majority of folks who are living in
31:09 

31:09 the US for it um I I might be wrong and
31:12 

31:12 there something I'm still figuring out
31:13 

31:13 I'm talking to like my my man managers
31:15 

31:15 as well and leads and hoping to reach
31:17 

31:17 out to other principal Engineers who
31:19 

31:19 hear their perspective that's the other
31:21 

31:21 thing is like being comfortable going to
31:25 

31:25 someone that you and like want to um
31:27 

31:27 Inspire to be and seeing how their
31:29 

31:29 journey is like and it's going to be
31:31 

31:31 different for everyone right like part
31:33 

31:33 of my journey to staff software engineer
31:35 

31:35 I was trying to pursue the exact Journey
31:39 

31:39 that another sta software engineer that
31:41 

31:41 I really looked up to um had but we were
31:44 

31:44 so different people we're so different
31:45 

31:45 we have very different strengths and
31:47 

31:47 weaknesses and so I when my manager told
31:50 

31:50 me like hey you're different and at that
31:52 

31:52 time I was also had just become a mom
31:54 

31:54 like I realized that I I have to stop
31:57 

31:57 this unhealthy person suit of being
31:59 

31:59 someone else that I'm not that really
32:01 

32:01 clicked in for me I okay yes I have to
32:02 

32:02 lean into my strengths and what I can
32:04 

32:04 bring to the team as a value multiplier
32:06 

32:06 and then use that so what's next for me
32:09 

32:09 I think it's still very up in the air I
32:11 

32:11 think you know logically the next step
32:14 

32:14 is principle software engineer but in in
32:17 

32:17 practice I I don't know yet I don't know
32:19 

32:19 how feasible that will be but I am um
32:21 

32:21 taking a you know being more aware of
32:24 

32:24 the bigger picture of what the company
32:26 

32:26 or the department is heading to ws and
32:28 

32:28 being I think trying to build up my
32:31 

32:31 knowledge about that yeah yeah some
32:34 

32:34 sometimes it's really important to get
32:35 

32:35 that time to look at things from like a
32:39 

32:39 far away like from a higher level like
32:41 

32:41 zoom out so I understand that definitely
32:44 

32:44 it's important to take breaks just to
32:46 

32:46 because if you're running too fast
32:48 

32:48 sometimes you don't know where you're
32:49 

32:49 going so it's important to stop look
32:51 

32:51 around take a break yeah so I love what
32:54 

32:54 everything you said about that I
32:55 

32:55 appreciate that and thank you so much
