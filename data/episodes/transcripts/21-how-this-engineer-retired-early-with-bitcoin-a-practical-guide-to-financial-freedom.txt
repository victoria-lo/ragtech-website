00:00 welcome to re Tech a place for bites and
00:02 

00:02 bentor where we talk about real life in
00:04 

00:04 tech for techies and non- techies alike
00:07 

00:07 we're Natasha and Salone rtech co-hosts
00:10 

00:10 and software Engineers we have our guest
00:12 

00:12 speaker Martin a recently retired
00:14 

00:14 software engineer in the last episode we
00:17 

00:17 talked to Martin about the tech
00:18 

00:18 Community culture of Open Source with
00:20 

00:20 his experience in the python User Group
00:22 

00:22 Tech Community in today's episode we'll
00:25 

00:25 be looking into how he managed his
00:27 

00:27 finances to retire relatively early as a
00:29 

00:29 software engineer
00:31 

00:31 [Music]
00:35 

00:35 yeah but now I kind of want to seg into
00:37 

00:37 your new label as a retired engineer as
00:40 

00:40 well as a that uh but to get to this
00:42 

00:42 stage of retirement obviously like you
00:45 

00:45 it has to do a lot with how you manage
00:47 

00:47 your finances otherwise you'll be
00:48 

00:48 working to the end of time um so we
00:50 

00:50 wanted to ask you in your perspective as
00:52 

00:52 as an engineer uh what is your take on
00:56 

00:56 how you manage your own finances M well
00:60 

01:00 we've already spoken about this before
01:02 

01:02 the the talk right so um my case as with
01:04 

01:04 everything that I do is is probably a
01:06 

01:06 little bit off the Beaten Track right
01:08 

01:08 and and um un
01:10 

01:10 unconventional um my retirement is not
01:13 

01:13 fueled by any of the work that I've ever
01:15 

01:15 done so like I've coded the code base
01:18 

01:18 for six startups of which probably four
01:21 

01:21 are still alive um I have shares in
01:24 

01:24 certain startups but none of that ever
01:26 

01:26 gave me a windfall of money so that's
01:28 

01:28 not what worked out for me in the end
01:30 

01:30 like like all this coding was fun but it
01:32 

01:32 wasn't lucrative I mean I I still make
01:34 

01:34 good salary I guess but um um nothing
01:37 

01:37 crazy not not nothing like you hear from
01:39 

01:39 Silicon Valley Engineers or anything
01:41 

01:41 like that right um pretty normal salary
01:43 

01:43 for Singapore terms what I did is I read
01:46 

01:46 the Bitcoin white paper 13 years ago I
01:49 

01:49 understood the implications of it and I
01:51 

01:51 sent an email to my five best friends in
01:54 

01:54 Germany and I said guys I found this
01:55 

01:55 thing we need to start buying this and
01:57 

01:57 so then the six of us all started
02:01 

02:01 dollar cost averaging interest so like
02:03 

02:03 this's this term DCA technically it's
02:05 

02:05 not right to say that this is dollar
02:06 

02:06 cost averaging because in reality dollar
02:09 

02:09 cost averaging means I have a lot of
02:10 

02:10 money how do I spend it do I spend it
02:12 

02:12 all at once and and and buy Bitcoin all
02:14 

02:14 at once or do I split it up and and
02:16 

02:16 every months or every interval I buy the
02:18 

02:18 same amount that would be dollar cost
02:20 

02:20 average I didn't have a lot of money but
02:22 

02:22 I still every month actually in the
02:25 

02:25 beginning every week I spent uh the same
02:27 

02:27 amount of money to buy Bitcoin right I
02:29 

02:29 asked my myself how much money can I
02:31 

02:31 flush down the toilet without affecting
02:33 

02:33 my lifestyle at all so then you know we
02:36 

02:36 waste a lot of money at Starbucks or
02:38 

02:38 Cinema or like fancy restaurants that
02:40 

02:40 not necessary and all kinds of crap that
02:42 

02:42 we buy and I decided maybe I can flush
02:45 

02:45 down like $40 every week some money that
02:49 

02:49 you're okay to uh lose yeah exactly
02:52 

02:52 that's in crypto that's what everybody
02:53 

02:53 says right don't invest what you can't
02:55 

02:55 afford to lose and at the time I I mean
02:58 

02:58 that was 13 years ago very humble
02:60 

02:60 Beginnings for me right I was like
03:02 

03:02 sleeping on the floor at at my wife's
03:04 

03:04 house because there was no room and um
03:07 

03:07 you know just started my own company and
03:09 

03:09 basically my salary was whatever was
03:12 

03:12 left at the end of the month from our
03:14 

03:14 profits and that was not much right and
03:17 

03:17 uh so some months I just earned like
03:19 

03:19 $500 and then the next months maybe I
03:21 

03:21 got a bigger project and I earned like
03:23 

03:23 three or $4,000 right and I mean
03:25 

03:25 obviously that grows and grows and grows
03:26 

03:26 as you got get better known and your
03:29 

03:29 portfolio speaks for itself um but yeah
03:32 

03:32 I just kept buying every single months
03:34 

03:34 no matter if the price goes up or goes
03:36 

03:36 down just buy so to me in the Bitcoin
03:38 

03:38 community in the in on crypto Twitter
03:40 

03:40 people call this DCA dollar cost average
03:43 

03:43 although technically it's not DCA right
03:45 

03:45 but um it's a bit scary because when
03:50 

03:50 when I started it the price was at the
03:52 

03:52 mount Cox Peak ,300 or so I started
03:56 

03:56 buying and it crashed down to like $200
03:59 

03:59 yeah but actually when your goal is to
04:02 

04:02 acquire more Bitcoin you are happy about
04:04 

04:04 that as it went down for my $40 I got
04:08 

04:08 more Bitcoins every every months right
04:11 

04:11 so I I ended up getting much more than I
04:13 

04:13 anticipated and then after four years
04:16 

04:16 the next Bull uh run happens and then
04:19 

04:19 that money that I invested became 10x
04:21 

04:21 more so now I had the psychological
04:23 

04:23 effect that oh actually if uh you know I
04:26 

04:26 took out the money that I had already
04:28 

04:28 invested by then just so so that
04:30 

04:30 psychologically I can tell myself if
04:32 

04:32 Bitcoin gets banned or crashes or
04:34 

04:34 whatever gets hacked at least I got
04:36 

04:36 those $5,000 that I spent last four
04:38 

04:38 years I got it back and then I bought
04:39 

04:39 myself a Macbook or whatever or some
04:41 

04:41 nice Christmas usually I buy nice
04:42 

04:42 Christmas gifts for all my
04:44 

04:44 friends so I want to be a
04:46 

04:46 friend so um um and I just kept doing
04:50 

04:50 this all the time I never really touched
04:53 

04:53 my stack right and as and and then
04:56 

04:56 suddenly you have this big pile of worst
04:59 

04:59 there and so then you feel more
05:01 

05:01 confident to increase the amount of
05:03 

05:03 money that you can Flash down the toilet
05:04 

05:04 also you probably you know progress in
05:07 

05:07 your career and you earn more salary as
05:09 

05:09 well so I would say like 5 to 10% of
05:11 

05:11 anyone's salary should be put away for
05:14 

05:14 savings and um and now people will say
05:18 

05:18 oh but you can't do this now anymore
05:19 

05:19 because you know Bitcoin has done its
05:21 

05:21 thing but that's not what I believe I
05:23 

05:23 mean when you think about how many
05:25 

05:25 people do own Bitcoin among your friends
05:28 

05:28 and family probably no one right it's
05:29 

05:29 still still incredibly Niche and um but
05:34 

05:34 now we have governments playing around
05:35 

05:35 with it you know like in in the US there
05:38 

05:38 are entire States who make new laws to
05:41 

05:41 make sure that people are always allowed
05:43 

05:43 to self- custody their own coins to make
05:45 

05:45 sure that mining operations um can
05:48 

05:48 function properly and so on so this
05:50 

05:50 thing is still growing and thriving and
05:53 

05:53 um that you know you have to think about
05:55 

05:55 Metal's law which is um the the value of
05:59 

05:59 a network um grows exponentially with
06:02 

06:02 the number of notes in the network right
06:04 

06:04 when you think about the telephone
06:05 

06:05 Network when there was in the beginning
06:07 

06:07 there was I think the US president and
06:09 

06:09 Russian president they had telephone
06:11 

06:11 line it's cool technology but not very
06:13 

06:13 useful as a network when every household
06:15 

06:15 in the world has a telephone it becomes
06:18 

06:18 incredibly disruptive technology that is
06:20 

06:20 incredibly valuable and money is a
06:22 

06:22 network actually right the more people
06:24 

06:24 use the same kind of money the more
06:27 

06:27 valuable that kind of money becomes and
06:29 

06:29 the more useful and that's why being the
06:33 

06:33 the country that has the global Reserve
06:35 

06:35 currency the US dollar makes the US
06:37 

06:37 dollar incredibly powerful because
06:38 

06:38 everywhere in the world every government
06:40 

06:40 wants to have US dollars so that they
06:42 

06:42 can buy oil right so the network effect
06:45 

06:45 is incredible and so Bitcoin would be
06:48 

06:48 even better right
06:50 

06:50 because the US can you can use the US
06:52 

06:52 dollar as economic Ware and U you know
06:56 

06:56 push down other countries Bitcoin would
06:59 

06:59 would eradicate that there would be
07:01 

07:01 finally a um um a currency that cannot
07:06 

07:06 be manipulated by any one government
07:08 

07:08 right and so it becomes a win-win
07:09 

07:09 situation for all the governments in the
07:11 

07:11 world right so I still believe that
07:15 

07:15 there's you know the the real mainstream
07:17 

07:17 effect of Bitcoin hasn't happened yet
07:19 

07:19 when you when you look at adoption S
07:20 

07:20 curve we are probably still at the very
07:22 

07:22 bottom where it's just going ballistic
07:25 

07:25 right early adopter stage yeah and so
07:28 

07:28 when you just think about medal's law
07:29 

07:29 and these things and game theory of you
07:31 

07:31 know the first country who prints money
07:34 

07:34 in order to buy Bitcoin uh in order to
07:36 

07:36 then Escape hyperinflation will will be
07:39 

07:39 the the country that will be the most
07:40 

07:40 wealthy after after hyperinflation
07:42 

07:42 globally happens and so on right so then
07:44 

07:44 all other countries will do this as well
07:46 

07:46 and then it becomes like a black hole
07:47 

07:47 that soaks in all the Fiat money and in
07:49 

07:49 the end the only money that has any
07:50 

07:50 value is Bitcoin right so I think this
07:52 

07:52 will eventually play out so um in my
07:55 

07:55 mind the the foure cycles of Bitcoin
07:59 

07:59 will continue to do it thing and anyone
08:02 

08:02 who still does this dollar cost
08:03 

08:03 averaging today will probably you know
08:07 

08:07 um experience quite a big appreciation
08:10 

08:10 of their investment every four years
08:13 

08:13 right so yeah I mean it's it's such a
08:16 

08:16 silly stupid simple thing that I did um
08:19 

08:19 but it worked out and and I I still
08:21 

08:21 think it will work out for other people
08:23 

08:23 as well um talking about managing
08:26 

08:26 finances right um I mentioned this
08:28 

08:28 earlier as well there's this app you
08:29 

08:29 need a budget
08:30 

08:30 oh yeah you need a budget.com I'm not
08:32 

08:32 affiliate with with them totally worse
08:35 

08:35 the subscription you have the book I
08:37 

08:37 have the book oh they have a book they
08:39 

08:39 they have a book which explains their
08:41 

08:41 the philosophy behind the app exactly so
08:45 

08:45 it's a super slick app and um you
08:48 

08:48 basically key in all the money that you
08:50 

08:50 spent right and and
08:53 

08:53 um and then when you key in that you got
08:55 

08:55 salary then you have the money sitting
08:57 

08:57 there on top as uh money to be uh put
08:60 

08:60 into buckets so then you have to come up
09:02 

09:02 with all the buckets what do I actually
09:03 

09:03 want to do with my money right so first
09:06 

09:06 you create all the buckets for your
09:07 

09:07 monthly builds electricity internet
09:09 

09:09 mobile phone and whatever right these
09:12 

09:12 things reappear then you create buckets
09:14 

09:14 for not so monthly things um I don't
09:17 

09:17 know buying clothes going to the
09:18 

09:18 hairdresser or whatever um and then
09:21 

09:21 actually I have buckets for birthday
09:22 

09:22 gifts for All My Friends Christmas gifts
09:24 

09:24 for all my friends if you add this up
09:26 

09:26 that's a lot of money per year that you
09:27 

09:27 spend on gifts actually but does any
09:29 

09:29 want plan for that no right when
09:31 

09:31 Christmas comes along you like damn I
09:33 

09:33 need why so many gifts I didn't save the
09:35 

09:35 money for that right so if you create
09:37 

09:37 all these buckets also done vacation you
09:39 

09:39 probably want to go on a fancy vacation
09:41 

09:41 which cost I don't know3 to $4,000 maybe
09:43 

09:43 you want to buy a new Macbook when your
09:45 

09:45 old one breaks down you have to plan for
09:47 

09:47 that you will eventually need a new
09:48 

09:48 backbook and these things cost $8,000
09:50 

09:50 nowadays right so um and then you can
09:53 

09:53 set the date like I want the new
09:54 

09:54 backbook four years from now then the
09:56 

09:56 app will break it down into monthly
09:59 

09:59 payments that you theoretically need to
10:01 

10:01 put aside so that in four years you have
10:03 

10:03 $8,000 for the mbook right so then every
10:06 

10:06 month when my money comes in uh in my
10:08 

10:08 bank account and that's the problem
10:10 

10:10 right when people don't have a savings
10:12 

10:12 account they get salary and they Splurge
10:15 

10:15 they feel like oh I'm so rich I can buy
10:16 

10:16 all kinds of things that you know I
10:18 

10:18 don't really need but actually at this
10:21 

10:21 app forces you at the beginning of the
10:22 

10:22 month to then take your salary and put
10:25 

10:25 it into all the buckets that you have
10:27 

10:27 created and then you realize oh
10:30 

10:30 I'm actually living above my means I
10:32 

10:32 don't have enough celery to fill the
10:35 

10:35 monthly little um drops into each bucket
10:38 

10:38 so that later on when I need that bucket
10:40 

10:40 I have the amount that I need right and
10:42 

10:42 that really changes your perspective on
10:45 

10:45 consumerism totally right um every time
10:48 

10:48 like when I go to like a restaurant or
10:50 

10:50 whatever can I actually afford uh
10:53 

10:53 grocery shop or like restaurant eating
10:54 

10:54 out there there's a category for eating
10:56 

10:56 out like this month I have actually
10:59 

10:59 already used up my budget for eating out
11:01 

11:01 right can I afford to have one more
11:03 

11:03 fancy meal at heido or whatever probably
11:07 

11:07 not right that means if I eat heidy L
11:09 

11:09 now I have to take this money away from
11:11 

11:11 another bucket that comes much later
11:13 

11:13 usually my MacBook bucket because that's
11:15 

11:15 always farar is it is a lot of money
11:17 

11:17 that I might not need uh at that time I
11:21 

11:21 can always wait a few more months before
11:22 

11:22 I then actually buy the makeb right but
11:25 

11:25 yeah um this app if anyone has trouble
11:29 

11:29 having month money left at the end of
11:31 

11:31 the month for savings right this app
11:34 

11:34 will get you there and then you have
11:36 

11:36 money left for savings so then you can
11:38 

11:38 put that money into Bitcoin right so
11:40 

11:40 have you been using this app since the
11:42 

11:42 beginning yeah yeah yeah for I've been
11:44 

11:44 using this for8 years or so yeah and and
11:48 

11:48 when I came to Singapore I was always
11:50 

11:50 broke when I started using that at
11:52 

11:52 literally like three months later I was
11:53 

11:53 like wow I have money at the end of the
11:56 

11:56 months there's money in my bank account
11:58 

11:58 when you start uh giving work to every
12:00 

12:00 single scent of your money then that's
12:03 

12:03 when you can actually see how much you
12:05 

12:05 were actually wasting how much and then
12:07 

12:07 you also care about like you you work so
12:10 

12:10 hard to make this money you want to put
12:12 

12:12 it for good use exactly so so that's the
12:14 

12:14 idea behind yeah it makes you plan your
12:17 

12:17 future right what do I want to do with
12:19 

12:19 my money and but it's just a
12:20 

12:20 psychological effect like you get a
12:22 

12:22 salary at the months of the at the
12:24 

12:24 beginning of the month and you actually
12:26 

12:26 know you can't touch this right it's
12:29 

12:29 already planed way and you and then it
12:31 

12:31 makes people realize that they live
12:33 

12:33 above their needs you usually not see
12:35 

12:35 that yeah yeah but I guess um it's as
12:39 

12:39 you can see it's nothing fancy I have
12:41 

12:41 not I've done no fancy Finance stuff um
12:44 

12:44 it's simply um exchanging my in my
12:47 

12:47 opinion worthless Fiat money to a more
12:51 

12:51 valuable uh store of value which is
12:54 

12:54 Bitcoin right um but it's amazing how in
12:57 

12:57 the beginning you believed and you
13:00 

13:00 understood Bitcoin such that even when
13:03 

13:03 it went down you had you had the
13:06 

13:06 understanding that it's it's just one of
13:08 

13:08 the lows it will go up cuz you know
13:11 

13:11 people might Panic at that time uh the
13:16 

13:16 crypto community on Reddit our Bitcoin
13:19 

13:19 right uh was very hilarious like the
13:21 

13:21 meming was so entertaining so as it went
13:25 

13:25 down the memes got more funny and so
13:27 

13:27 you're just like browsing every morning
13:29 

13:29 and you see see all the cool memes and
13:30 

13:30 you're okay everybody's having fun it's
13:32 

13:32 probably not not so uh not not such a
13:34 

13:34 big problem maybe I should be worried
13:36 

13:36 and um but yeah the white paper is worth
13:39 

13:39 reading the Bitcoin PDF it's only like
13:41 

13:41 nine pages or so and I think the only
13:44 

13:44 difficult thing in terms of computer
13:45 

13:45 science is Merkel trees so when I read
13:48 

13:48 the white paper I went to Wikipedia and
13:50 

13:50 I I read about Merkel trees did some
13:53 

13:53 online tutorial that makes it visualize
13:56 

13:56 little bit and so then I intellectually
13:58 

13:58 understood what trees are and then you
14:00 

14:00 can actually fully understand how this
14:02 

14:02 money Works isn't that unbelievable can
14:04 

14:04 you understand how a central bank Works
14:06 

14:06 nobody can understand that nobody knows
14:08 

14:08 how the Federal Reserve Bank Works where
14:10 

14:10 does the money come from nobody knows
14:11 

14:11 where the money comes from right so we
14:13 

14:13 have a system there that just explains
14:15 

14:15 the entire Financial system in like nine
14:17 

14:17 pages that are accessible to anyone um
14:20 

14:20 you don't need to be a rocket scientist
14:22 

14:22 to understand it's just it's that to me
14:25 

14:25 is already proof enough that this will
14:26 

14:26 prevail right um I been doing dollar
14:30 

14:30 cost averaging with uh ETFs yeah so I
14:34 

14:34 mean it it doesn't go 10x but so so my
14:38 

14:38 my annual interest rate is on average
14:43 

14:43 40% wow I don't think you can find an EF
14:45 

14:45 that gives you 40% per year no I mean
14:49 

14:49 people will always say yeah yeah yeah
14:50 

14:50 but you got in early and you know that
14:52 

14:52 it appreciated 20,000% no but I still
14:56 

14:56 think 12 years from now somebody who
14:59 

14:59 started now will also experience a 5 to
15:02 

15:02 10,000% appreciation right so U don't
15:05 

15:05 don't dismiss this as oh I missed the
15:07 

15:07 train and you just got lucky because you
15:08 

15:08 got in early and anyone who says you
15:11 

15:11 just got lucky I challenge you to huddle
15:14 

15:14 huddle means to hold on to your coins
15:16 

15:16 and don't spend them puddled through uh
15:18 

15:18 three major crashes right it crashes 85%
15:22 

15:22 each after each Peak it crashes 85% and
15:25 

15:25 then have the balls to not sell Panic
15:28 

15:28 sell on the way down is not so easy
15:30 

15:30 psychologically right yeah yeah I think
15:32 

15:32 the caveat here that you're also putting
15:34 

15:34 out is one make sure that it's money
15:36 

15:36 that you are willing to flush down the
15:38 

15:38 drain you know and that starts with like
15:40 

15:40 budgeting and knowing how much you can
15:41 

15:41 even put aide H you need a budget.com uh
15:45 

15:45 the second principle here and I think
15:46 

15:46 maybe it's because of a trade as an
15:48 

15:48 engineer also the tendency to want to
15:50 

15:50 look into what you're actually investing
15:52 

15:52 I think uh the the the first time you
15:54 

15:54 read the white paper you know you went
15:56 

15:56 the extra mile to understand how a
15:57 

15:57 blockchain even works that was like my
15:59 

15:59 Journey as well but I took it down the
16:01 

16:01 research route because I was like this
16:02 

16:02 is really cool and I want to like look
16:04 

16:04 at blockchain more but to have that
16:06 

16:06 interest to want to pursue that more
16:08 

16:08 understand the mechanics behind it and
16:09 

16:09 know that this is this is a sound
16:11 

16:11 technology and it's never going to lose
16:14 

16:14 its value um even though like right now
16:17 

16:17 you know that there are cycles of
16:18 

16:18 fluctuations but these are normal like
16:20 

16:20 you said it's a cycle it happens
16:22 

16:22 iteratively and there's a reason behind
16:24 

16:24 that it's driven you know both by um the
16:27 

16:27 way that the basically yeah oh yeah the
16:30 

16:30 having and and stuff like that and you
16:31 

16:31 also know about um you know theories
16:34 

16:34 beyond that for example adoption curves
16:36 

16:36 we know that it's like the early
16:37 

16:37 adoption stage at each point of time
16:41 

16:41 wherever you might feel some sort of
16:43 

16:43 anxiety or Panic you go back to logic
16:45 

16:45 you go back to like what is the
16:46 

16:46 long-term outcome here so that's the
16:48 

16:48 second principle that we're really
16:49 

16:49 looking at here and the third to also
16:53 

16:53 like not falter when it comes to like
16:55 

16:55 those dips I think when it comes to
16:58 

16:58 investment basically we're talking about
16:59 

16:59 Investments here right um it's really
17:02 

17:02 about that psychological aspect going in
17:05 

17:05 uh to invest um I think like for me I
17:09 

17:09 did try out like uh uh trading in crypto
17:12 

17:12 for a bit I did try out stock trading
17:13 

17:13 for a bit and um the thing is I knew my
17:17 

17:17 own psychological uh demeanors and
17:19 

17:19 tendencies through that small experience
17:20 

17:20 I put $3,000 aside and tried it out I
17:23 

17:23 knew I panicked like way too much even
17:24 

17:24 if it's rooted in logic so that's why I
17:26 

17:26 turned to like investing in more
17:28 

17:28 tangible so I invested in housing in
17:31 

17:31 Singapore so I think it's also a lot
17:33 

17:33 about like knowing yourself but also
17:35 

17:35 letting yourself experiment going
17:37 

17:37 through those principles and then okay
17:39 

17:39 even even if I have those principles in
17:41 

17:41 place this is still not really for me
17:43 

17:43 yeah then instead of Bitcoin there's
17:44 

17:44 something else that you can try you know
17:46 

17:46 we're not saying here that everybody
17:48 

17:48 needs to go to bitcoin but it would
17:49 

17:49 actually be good if everybody did but
17:52 

17:52 we're we're also saying that you know if
17:53 

17:53 you want to like make that investment
17:55 

17:55 follow these principles and do what is
17:57 

17:57 best for you don't be afraid to
17:59 

17:59 experiment but experiment with money you
18:01 

18:01 can put aside that's one what you said
18:02 

18:02 about trading is also very important I
18:04 

18:04 mean I've been reading about Bitcoin
18:07 

18:07 every single day of my life for 13 years
18:11 

18:11 for at least two hours per day so at at
18:14 

18:14 the beginning I was completely obsessed
18:16 

18:16 with it right I would I would literally
18:18 

18:18 have sleepless nights where I just can't
18:19 

18:19 sleep and I would just browse and read
18:21 

18:21 more stuff and read everything about it
18:23 

18:23 I have every single Bitcoin book ever
18:25 

18:25 published in my library at
18:27 

18:27 home I'm actually going to build an llm
18:30 

18:30 I will scan all the books vectorize them
18:32 

18:32 and I will create an oracle that you can
18:35 

18:35 ask any question about Bitcoin and it
18:36 

18:36 will reply back based on the um text in
18:40 

18:40 those books um you're building that or
18:42 

18:42 um that's going to be one of my hobby
18:45 

18:45 projects looking forward to it um well I
18:47 

18:47 don't know if I can publish this because
18:49 

18:49 technically it's copyright infringement
18:50 

18:50 right so I'm going to reach out to those
18:51 

18:51 authors I think most Bitcoin authors are
18:54 

18:54 um Anarchist crypto cyber punks anyways
18:57 

18:57 they wouldn't care if somebody does this
18:58 

18:58 I think M and I mean in the end um you
19:01 

19:01 still wouldn't be able to read the
19:02 

19:02 actual pages of the book that I have
19:04 

19:04 scanmed you would only just get answers
19:07 

19:07 um so people will still have to buy the
19:08 

19:08 original books if they want to you know
19:10 

19:10 dive deeper right but anyways um
19:12 

19:12 speaking about trading so I've been
19:14 

19:14 obsessed with it right I've looked at
19:16 

19:16 the Bitcoin price every 10 minutes the
19:19 

19:19 first few years right and you would
19:21 

19:21 think that oh you you would think that I
19:24 

19:24 know everything about it and I've seen
19:25 

19:25 the price movements I have a feeling for
19:27 

19:27 it no way every single time when I told
19:30 

19:30 myself oh now I will sell a little bit
19:32 

19:32 so I can buy back when it drips or I
19:34 

19:34 will put in a little bit more because
19:37 

19:37 you know it's going to appreciate soon
19:39 

19:39 not not once have I been right every
19:42 

19:42 single time the exact opposite of what I
19:44 

19:44 thought would happen happened right and
19:46 

19:46 so um I mean that was I mean at some
19:48 

19:48 point I had so much money that I can do
19:49 

19:49 these playful things and try a little
19:52 

19:52 bit of trading without losing everything
19:54 

19:54 but it never worked out so even somebody
19:56 

19:56 completely obsessed with this and having
19:58 

19:58 a lot of spare time
19:60 

19:60 you are if you if you're not a
20:01 

20:01 professional Trader don't touch this
20:03 

20:03 thing as as a trading vehicle do not
20:05 

20:05 touch this just do DCA don't worry about
20:07 

20:07 the price and forget about everything
20:08 

20:08 else yeah for sure for sure I think
20:10 

20:10 that's really good advice like could be
20:12 

20:12 DCA for anything like for Salon casic uh
20:16 

20:16 well this this famous quote from I think
20:17 

20:17 Warren Buffett right time in the market
20:20 

20:20 beats timing the market right patience
20:24 

20:24 yeah exactly just have to bet on the
20:26 

20:26 right horse just right how do you find
20:27 

20:27 the right horse is it NV now is a Tesla
20:31 

20:31 who knows yeah yeah yeah but definitely
20:33 

20:33 just do your due diligence you know and
20:35 

20:35 try not to succumb to like the uh the
20:37 

20:37 lows of it yeah try also not to succumb
20:40 

20:40 to the highs of it yeah as you said not
20:43 

20:43 professional Traders you're you
20:44 

20:44 shouldn't be reacting should be just
20:46
