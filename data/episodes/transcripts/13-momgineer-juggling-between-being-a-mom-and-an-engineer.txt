00:00 just in our culture it's like we have to
00:03 

00:03 kind of be quiet and like just do our
00:05 

00:05 best silently see a lot of parallels
00:08 

00:08 between engineering or the way like my
00:10 

00:10 engineering values are as well as my
00:12 

00:12 parenting uh values but at the back of
00:14 

00:14 my mind I'm not going to lie I was just
00:16 

00:16 thinking about how do I get back to work
00:18 

00:18 from this I literally did not touch my
00:21 

00:21 laptop at all there's no way like you
00:24 

00:24 are figuring so much out your sleep
00:26 

00:26 deprived I will be irresponsible
00:29 

00:29 [Music]
00:32 

00:32 welcome to R Tech the place for bites
00:34 

00:34 and ventor my name is Victoria I'm a
00:35 

00:35 Solutions engineer I'm Salon software
00:38 

00:38 engine and today we have a guest speaker
00:41 

00:41 y yeah so we're very happy to have y in
00:44 

00:44 this episode today so maybe human first
00:47 

00:47 you can introduce yourself hi I'm um and
00:49 

00:49 I'm a software engineer and I'm a mom of
00:51 

00:51 two very naughty
00:53 

00:53 boys I also term that Mom Jer yeah so I
00:57 

00:57 think in today's episode we're going to
00:59 

00:59 be talking about uh human's life as a
01:01 

01:01 mom as well as an engineer and how she
01:03 

01:03 balances that so maybe first human you
01:06 

01:06 can explain to us what the term mom
01:08 

01:08 engineer means and also about your
01:10 

01:10 day-to-day life as that role yeah so Mom
01:12 

01:12 junior is simply a mom who's also an
01:14 

01:14 engineer and I think the reason why I
01:18 

01:18 kind of put the two together is because
01:20 

01:20 I see a lot of parallels between
01:22 

01:22 engineering or the way that my
01:24 

01:24 engineering values are as well as my
01:26 

01:26 parenting uh values so Mom junor just
01:29 

01:29 made the most sense for how I like you
01:31 

01:31 know balance the my work life as well as
01:34 

01:34 my personal life and my and motherhood I
01:36 

01:36 think we can all agree that it's first
01:38 

01:38 of all it's very challenging just being
01:40 

01:40 a mom and it's also very challenging
01:42 

01:42 just being an engineer but you're doing
01:44 

01:44 both at once we're very curious how do
01:46 

01:46 you juggle on that and how do you even
01:49 

01:49 like switch between if like you have to
01:51 

01:51 switch between those roles yeah it's
01:53 

01:53 it's not easy I think it took me a while
01:56 

01:56 to even get to a point where it feels
01:59 

01:59 natural to me now maybe I'll take a step
02:02 

02:02 back and like talk about when I first
02:03 

02:03 had my when I had my first kid um this
02:06 

02:06 was a about 4 and a half years ago now
02:09 

02:09 but I remember very clearly feeling so
02:12 

02:12 thrown into the other end when I had my
02:16 

02:16 kid and then was trying to figure out
02:18 

02:18 how do I even get back to work and being
02:20 

02:20 out on leave for I took about 20 weeks
02:22 

02:22 to start and then I saved the rest of my
02:24 

02:24 leave for when he turned one because you
02:26 

02:26 had to finish using it by the time he
02:28 

02:28 turned one um and I didn't want to miss
02:30 

02:30 of the important milestones and also
02:32 

02:32 like the first few months of having a
02:34 

02:34 baby it's so precious you're figuring
02:36 

02:36 out who you are who your baby is and
02:41 

02:41 establishing the communication right all
02:43 

02:43 they can do is just fail flil around and
02:47 

02:47 cry and you're like do you want milk
02:49 

02:49 your diaper change like are you sleepy
02:51 

02:51 are you tired and you know every baby is
02:54 

02:54 different so whatever you read in the
02:55 

02:55 books may not even be what your baby is
02:58 

02:58 like you know not what your baby is um
03:00 

03:00 trending towards right so a lot of it
03:03 

03:03 was figuring it out and I was very
03:05 

03:05 grateful to have that time to figure
03:08 

03:08 that out as a new mom but at the back of
03:10 

03:10 my mind I'm not going to lie I was just
03:12 

03:12 thinking about how do I get back to work
03:14 

03:14 from this I literally did not touch my
03:17 

03:17 laptop at all there's no way like you
03:19 

03:19 are figuring so much out you are sleep
03:22 

03:22 deprived I will be irresponsible if I
03:24 

03:24 was you know trying to do anything work
03:26 

03:26 related um I was gone for so long I
03:29 

03:29 forgot which editor I was using I was
03:30 

03:30 like is it vs vs code or was it Vim like
03:33 

03:33 I don't even remember now um but I do
03:36 

03:36 remember coming back to work and first
03:40 

03:40 of all setting expectations my working
03:43 

03:43 hours were pretty strict because you
03:45 

03:45 know babies need to be fed at certain
03:48 

03:48 times and and you know um uh they need
03:51 

03:51 to sleep at certain times and if you
03:52 

03:52 mess up with that if you're not
03:54 

03:54 consistent about it you can really throw
03:56 

03:56 yourself into a loop and the baby's just
03:58 

03:58 going to be like yeah I you know what my
04:01 

04:01 needs were you were the one who didn't
04:03 

04:03 meet them so the biggest curveball is is
04:06 

04:06 the baby right um so I set expectations
04:10 

04:10 with my calendar I just put like my
04:12 

04:12 working hours anything outside of the
04:14 

04:14 working hours are you know you probably
04:17 

04:17 won't get a response or I'll be very
04:18 

04:18 very slow to respond and my team was
04:21 

04:21 very supportive of that my manager was
04:23 

04:23 very supportive of that and at work they
04:24 

04:24 have this thing right where you cannot
04:26 

04:26 go back to being on call until at least
04:28 

04:28 90 days after you come back from bonding
04:30 

04:30 leave so that goes from birthing parents
04:32 

04:32 as well as non- birthing parents who
04:34 

04:34 work at the company because they do
04:35 

04:35 realize like it it you become very sleep
04:38 

04:38 deprived and you do have to you know
04:40 

04:40 catch up on a lot of contacts that you
04:41 

04:41 might have lost while being out um so I
04:43 

04:43 was grateful for that um other things
04:46 

04:46 were having another you know again like
04:50 

04:50 the there's this whole tribe of parents
04:53 

04:53 um at my workplace who are also who also
04:55 

04:55 went through this who have either years
04:58 

04:58 of experience in it too or are also
04:60 

04:60 freshly new moms that I could lean into
05:03 

05:03 and just really try to get um some
05:07 

05:07 wisdom from their experience but again
05:10 

05:10 personal right like baby's different
05:12 

05:12 mom's different so I always take their
05:15 

05:15 um advice with a grain of salt and see
05:16 

05:16 how it applies in my situation I do
05:18 

05:18 think that it really helped to have a
05:20 

05:20 good company uh who understands what it
05:24 

05:24 what it was like to go through a
05:26 

05:26 Parenthood for the first time for the
05:28 

05:28 second time like each time has it
05:30 

05:30 challenges and another thing that I did
05:34 

05:34 was to kind of give myself space and
05:36 

05:36 Grace I think I was trying to chase this
05:39 

05:39 Cadence of productivity that I had pre
05:42 

05:42 kids and after a while I was just like
05:45 

05:45 this is not I'm not going to achieve
05:47 

05:47 that I'm going to be smarter about how I
05:51 

05:51 want to So-Cal quantify my work now it's
05:54 

05:54 no longer about how many PRS or PO
05:56 

05:56 requests I'm I'm shipping how many
05:57 

05:57 changes and how many you know uh code
06:00 

06:00 commits I'm getting into production um
06:04 

06:04 it was more about you know impact now I
06:07 

06:07 was thinking more about like how the
06:09 

06:09 work that I do do how is that is that
06:12 

06:12 you know high impact low impact is it um
06:15 

06:15 something that is not high priority also
06:17 

06:17 so I was I was I think a bit more
06:19 

06:19 strategic and intentional about what I
06:21 

06:21 was working on and not everything you
06:24 

06:24 know when you have a kid your priorities
06:26 

06:26 shift so what used to stress me out at
06:29 

06:29 work like even the smallest like oh my
06:31 

06:31 goodness you know something went out of
06:32 

06:32 production the text is wrong like that
06:35 

06:35 doesn't face me anymore um because the
06:38 

06:38 thing that does face you as a new parent
06:39 

06:39 is is my kid getting enough um are they
06:43 

06:43 you know if they're sick like you know
06:45 

06:45 what can I do and especially when they
06:47 

06:47 were a few months old they didn't have
06:49 

06:49 all of their shots like do I take them
06:51 

06:51 out what's the risk in that it's all
06:52 

06:52 about the my baby um and so the work the
06:56 

06:56 work problems were were problems I'm not
06:58 

06:58 going to say like okay it didn't face me
06:59 

06:59 at all but just like different kind of
07:01 

07:01 reaction now I could be actually calmer
07:04 

07:04 about thinking through what problems we
07:07 

07:07 had and then being more strategic about
07:11 

07:11 how we want to solve them and I was less
07:13 

07:13 reactive I was more proactive about okay
07:16 

07:16 if I do make this change what other
07:19 

07:19 things might come up right or how do I
07:21 

07:21 have dashboards in place that can give
07:23 

07:23 me a better idea of like you know the
07:26 

07:26 impact of this change the request times
07:29 

07:29 um any logging that I can add to give
07:32 

07:32 more information if anything goes wrong
07:34 

07:34 like what was the situation of the
07:36 

07:36 entity or the the you at that time point
07:38 

07:38 in time and so also communication wise I
07:42 

07:42 was more deliberate I was also more I
07:45 

07:45 was better about boundary setting like I
07:48 

07:48 used to answer all kinds of things at
07:51 

07:51 all times of the day and you know when
07:53 

07:53 you have a kids like you don't have that
07:56 

07:56 choice bath time bedtime dinner time all
07:58 

07:58 these things and it you know we were
08:00 

08:00 living in the states back then so we
08:02 

08:02 didn't have our family uh to help and I
08:06 

08:06 mean my parents did come over for like a
08:08 

08:08 month or two uh just for the transition
08:10 

08:10 phase but they had to come back to
08:11 

08:11 Singapore so we had to figure things out
08:13 

08:13 like me and my husband and yeah I think
08:16 

08:16 through that it just becomes important
08:19 

08:19 to you or it comes becomes clear like
08:22 

08:22 what is important to you and you have
08:24 

08:24 that list and I'm a stickler I'm like a
08:27 

08:27 you know planner I I love things when
08:30 

08:30 they are organized because I feel like
08:32 

08:32 when your mind is cluttered then
08:34 

08:34 everything else also feels cluttered um
08:36 

08:36 and so I had my calendar was like my um
08:41 

08:41 the thing that I would yes yeah like my
08:44 

08:44 husband has you know if it says like oh
08:46 

08:46 you know I'll have um XYZ lunch or
08:49 

08:49 whatever uh meeting and I say okay can
08:52 

08:52 you just make sure it's in our joint
08:53 

08:53 calendar or something so that I know
08:55 

08:55 like when I have to make sure I was
08:57 

08:57 available for my my my kid um and vice
09:01 

09:01 versa and so I think the calendar really
09:05 

09:05 helped and spacing out time too because
09:08 

09:08 at work um I still had to pump right and
09:11 

09:11 I needed I didn't want to say like
09:13 

09:13 pumping in my calendar so I would just
09:15 

09:15 say like Focus time or do not disturb
09:17 

09:17 time and it's a very common practice and
09:20 

09:20 I think like we should normalize this
09:22 

09:22 right like it's a thing we got to do as
09:24 

09:24 birthing parents and for for you know if
09:27 

09:27 we choose to breastfeed our kid then
09:29 

09:29 that's just time you have to take out of
09:30 

09:30 your day and each time was like 30
09:32 

09:32 minutes and you do that at the start 6
09:35 

09:35 to eight times like literally hours of
09:37 

09:37 your day goes into this activity right
09:40 

09:40 um and I I felt so guilty at first of
09:42 

09:42 like should I be taking this I'm suppos
09:44 

09:44 to be working during this time but I
09:45 

09:45 could eat my lunch while pumping you
09:47 

09:47 know it's like I would try to be more
09:49 

09:49 efficient about the usage of my time so
09:51 

09:51 that I have more focused time another
09:54 

09:54 thing was having a physical
09:57 

09:57 door as to your office was very helpful
09:60 

09:60 for me because back back in the US we
10:02 

10:02 had a basement and at first it was like
10:03 

10:03 very open I was just working in the
10:05 

10:05 basement but I could hear my baby crying
10:07 

10:07 and it was just so hard to like focus on
10:09 

10:09 work you cannot you asked about
10:11 

10:11 compartmentalizing I couldn't
10:12 

10:12 compartmentalize during that time and I
10:14 

10:14 was like we need to change out the guest
10:16 

10:16 bedroom and switch into an office proper
10:19 

10:19 because I need to close the door I need
10:20 

10:20 to be able to focus on work noise
10:22 

10:22 cancelling headphones only get you that
10:23 

10:23 far you know um and thankfully we found
10:25 

10:25 a very good nanny so she was able to
10:27 

10:27 take care of um my kid back then and
10:30 

10:30 while I focus on work and I think after
10:33 

10:33 we established the calendar the the the
10:36 

10:36 dayto day um regime and having a very
10:40 

10:40 good nny that we could trust that was
10:42 

10:42 only then I had peace of mind at this
10:45 

10:45 point my kids probably a year old okay
10:47 

10:47 so it did take me a really long time
10:49 

10:49 from 4 months to like a a year of
10:52 

10:52 figuring that out I was not the most
10:54 

10:54 efficient I was probably lagging behind
10:57 

10:57 a lot um but I did really try to
11:01 

11:01 prioritize yeah that's very like
11:04 

11:04 basically you're a
11:06 

11:06 superhero yes that actually sounded like
11:08 

11:08 a superwoman sounds like a life of being
11:11 

11:11 a superhero full time and wow what I'm
11:15 

11:15 kind of speechless by how much effort
11:17 

11:17 have to put into this not only do you
11:19 

11:19 have to be deliberate with how you
11:21 

11:21 schedule yourself um prioritizing
11:24 

11:24 different task but you also have to like
11:27 

11:27 it always gets to you because when
11:28 

11:28 you're a mom all you think about is your
11:30 

11:30 baby like it that's just Instinct right
11:32 

11:32 so like how you mentioned you couldn't
11:34 

11:34 ignore your baby's cries like that is
11:36 

11:36 very even with noise cancelling
11:38 

11:38 headphones how can you be like 100% at
11:41 

11:41 ease yeah so you going through all this
11:45 

11:45 W even though I'm not a Mom myself I
11:47 

11:47 have so much empathy like just thinking
11:49 

11:49 about how you have to like figure all
11:51 

11:51 this out like in the first year I think
11:53 

11:53 that's really tough to do I was like I
11:56 

11:56 was just thinking like it has to be uh
11:58 

11:58 the company that you're working working
11:60 

11:60 for has to be really understanding
12:02 

12:02 because they need they should be
12:05 

12:05 understanding that for at least a year
12:08 

12:08 this employee would take some time to
12:10 

12:10 adjust it is okay for there to be
12:13 

12:13 inefficiency if for example uh you're
12:16 

12:16 not able to meet your kpis you you are
12:18 

12:18 inefficient you are doing work you are
12:20 

12:20 getting things done uh but maybe not as
12:23 

12:23 efficiently as you should be at your
12:25 

12:25 level maybe uh and I'm guessing that
12:29 

12:29 would be in going back to work cuz I've
12:31 

12:31 heard from my friends at least they were
12:32 

12:32 actually very uh they had anxiousness
12:36 

12:36 when you know in sing We have 16 weeks
12:39 

12:39 for uh I think for some companies so 16
12:42 

12:42 weeks are ending you know you have to go
12:43 

12:43 back to work the next week so much
12:45 

12:45 anxiousness like oh no especially in the
12:48 

12:48 tech industry things would have changed
12:50 

12:50 a lot in in 16 weeks uh how do I you
12:53 

12:53 know get back up there how do I compete
12:55 

12:55 with my colleagues how do you how did
12:57 

12:57 you deal with this as well as a new
13:01 

13:01 found life at home Yes
13:03 

13:03 yes again I think it was like leaning
13:06 

13:06 into the tribe the the the women or the
13:08 

13:08 non- birthing parents sorry the birthing
13:11 

13:11 parents that walked through that and
13:12 

13:12 have been through it they've shared so
13:14 

13:14 many of their experiences one thing that
13:17 

13:17 they shared was that I found was really
13:18 

13:18 key was the offboarding and the
13:21 

13:21 onboarding uh thinking about coming back
13:23 

13:23 from leave as a new job how do you deal
13:27 

13:27 with that right like it's essentially
13:29 

13:29 you will be in a similar position as
13:31 

13:31 someone joining the company for the
13:32 

13:32 first time or someone who's new to the
13:34 

13:34 team there will be time for you to on
13:36 

13:36 board and like you mentioned the company
13:37 

13:37 also has to be very understanding um and
13:40 

13:40 I'm grateful that my company does have
13:42 

13:42 that understanding and that my manager
13:43 

13:43 at that time had that understanding as
13:44 

13:44 well like I'm coming in and treat me as
13:47 

13:47 a new hire right I'm going to take time
13:50 

13:50 to come run back up to whatever changes
13:53 

13:53 has happened and be up to date with
13:55 

13:55 current state I declared inbox
13:57 

13:57 bankruptcy so every notification I had
13:60 

14:00 just Mark is red or delete or something
14:04 

14:04 right there's no way I'm catching up to
14:05 

14:05 4 months 6 months worth of backlog um
14:09 

14:09 and and you mentioned kpis I think it's
14:11 

14:11 an important conversation to have with
14:13 

14:13 your manager if something seems very out
14:15 

14:15 of reach for you personally then I think
14:17 

14:17 it's a a good you know you need to have
14:21 

14:21 that conversation with your manager and
14:23 

14:23 decide on whether there's any levers you
14:24 

14:24 can tweak um and sometimes some kpis
14:28 

14:28 have room for interpr ation uh if
14:31 

14:31 they're not like you know very strictly
14:32 

14:32 a quota you must meet or numbers you
14:34 

14:34 must meet then you could have maybe come
14:38 

14:38 up with different ideas and be creative
14:39 

14:39 about how you want to meet those kpis um
14:43 

14:43 for example if like one of the kpis is
14:45 

14:45 to make our processes you know 80% more
14:48 

14:48 efficient or something well then I will
14:50 

14:50 think about how can I leverage
14:53 

14:53 automation or tools or changes in our
14:56 

14:56 workflow to make it more efficient what
14:58 

14:58 are the inefficiencies to begin with so
15:01 

15:01 you're thinking about it more like from
15:03 

15:03 a strategic standpoint and I would say
15:06 

15:06 try to work smarter about it versus in
15:09 

15:09 the past I would like work harder now
15:11 

15:11 like there's no way I there's no way I
15:13 

15:13 can times 10 I'm not 10times 10 engineer
15:16 

15:16 anymore I wasn't to begin with um but
15:20 

15:20 you know it's more about like what
15:23 

15:23 problem are you trying to solve and is
15:24 

15:24 there a more creative way we can go
15:26 

15:26 about solving that having that
15:27 

15:27 conversation with your manager is also
15:29 

15:29 important because I think they want to
15:31 

15:31 at the end of the day you're a software
15:32 

15:32 engineer or engineer and you're a
15:34 

15:34 problem solver how you get to Sol the
15:37 

15:37 solution um is also an important thing
15:40 

15:40 to show your manager right and if they
15:42 

15:42 can see that you're creative about it
15:44 

15:44 then okay you know it it's something
15:46 

15:46 that I know that human is thinking about
15:49 

15:49 sonone is thinking about Victoria is
15:50 

15:50 thinking about um and she's coming up
15:52 

15:52 with solutions that maybe be out of the
15:54 

15:54 norm but gets us to where we want to be
15:57 

15:57 so I think that's important as well to
15:59 

15:59 recognize
15:60 

15:60 not everything is like a number that
16:01 

16:01 needs to be hit or if you if it is a
16:04 

16:04 number you need to be to hit then how
16:06 

16:06 can we get there in the non-traditional
16:08 

16:08 ways um yeah I think that's that's how
16:11 

16:11 we would go about it did you also have
16:13 

16:13 like uh circumstances where you'll
16:15 

16:15 realize like your colleagues they are
16:17 

16:17 also working equally hard and then and
16:20 

16:20 but then you mean just because she gave
16:22 

16:22 birth she gets to be you know have more
16:25 

16:25 leeway if it did I never felt that um um
16:29 

16:29 I was also very cognizant about uring
16:33 

16:33 that I'm not never using the oh I have a
16:36 

16:36 mommy brain
16:38 

16:38 excuse I tried to to keep like being a
16:41 

16:41 new mom out of it what I tried to do was
16:44 

16:44 like Hey I do need time I'm I'm having
16:47 

16:47 stricter
16:48 

16:48 boundaries I will take up projects I
16:51 

16:51 will you know Dr Dr I me the directly
16:54 

16:54 responsible individual for a project I
16:56 

16:56 will lead it um but as as long as my my
16:60 

16:60 manager is also comfortable right
17:01 

17:01 because if I were treated as a new hire
17:05 

17:05 would my manager feel comfortable giving
17:06 

17:06 me a project right off the B probably
17:08 

17:08 not and I'll be fine with that but that
17:10 

17:10 doesn't mean that it's okay to not
17:12 

17:12 include me in discussions I think my pet
17:16 

17:16 peeve is when people make assumptions
17:18 

17:18 about you know new moms or about folks
17:21 

17:21 coming back from a extended period of
17:23 

17:23 time that oh you know you probably I'm
17:24 

17:24 just going to assume that you just want
17:25 

17:25 to recover I think that is my biggest
17:28 

17:28 pet peeve um where where you know maybe
17:31 

17:31 I do want to be participative and maybe
17:33 

17:33 I am yearning that because I've been
17:35 

17:35 talking to a baby or toddler for Way
17:39 

17:39 Long like I'm done with the whole like
17:42 

17:42 um you know monologue that happens when
17:45 

17:45 they haven't they haven't learned yet
17:47 

17:47 how to speak and I'm just constantly you
17:49 

17:49 know reading to them things like that I
17:51 

17:51 I'm yearning that you know uh
17:54 

17:54 participation that allows me to reain
17:57 

17:57 the muscle that you know I probably have
17:59 

17:59 to to hone again um in those discussions
18:02 

18:02 and so no I would hope nobody feels that
18:05 

18:05 they would think that you know oh she's
18:06 

18:06 coming from Leave You must give her more
18:08 

18:08 leeway or a manager to think that I must
18:10 

18:10 give her more leeway because she came
18:11 

18:11 out from leave I I would hope that never
18:13 

18:13 crosses people's minds because at the
18:15 

18:15 end of the day yeah you like it is my
18:18 

18:18 responsibility as an individual to also
18:20 

18:20 come back to speed and also be
18:23 

18:23 very um I think very clear about my
18:27 

18:27 intentions so I came back and I so said
18:29 

18:29 that you know I know that I've missed a
18:32 

18:32 lot of contacts while I was out where
18:34 

18:34 can I read the tldr what are some issues
18:37 

18:37 that I can you know read up on so I can
18:39 

18:39 get myself up to speed what are the most
18:41 

18:41 important things because there's no way
18:42 

18:42 I'm going through all of the backlog or
18:44 

18:44 all the step conversations or web
18:46 

18:46 notifications I've gotten but where's
18:48 

18:48 the latest on this I can read up on and
18:50 

18:50 so I think you know showing the
18:52 

18:52 initiative that hey I'm ready I'm ready
18:54 

18:54 to come back I'm ready to be back in the
18:56 

18:56 game but please help me out in like the
18:58 

18:58 tldr right I think that's where I feel
19:03 

19:03 that companies should strive towards
19:05 

19:05 that team should strive towards and
19:07 

19:07 Engineering managers or managers as as a
19:09 

19:09 whole should strive towards I know we're
19:11 

19:11 not there as a society today um and
19:14 

19:14 that's something that I think coming
19:16 

19:16 back to Singapore was another thing that
19:18 

19:18 I hope to help you know break this kind
19:22 

19:22 of stereotype and normalize that how
19:27 

19:27 else are we going to have um you know
19:30 

19:30 kids and and you know help our society
19:33 

19:33 um build up the future generation if
19:36 

19:36 we're not supporting the ones who are
19:37 

19:37 building up this generation so we can't
19:40 

19:40 really have you know say one thing and
19:42 

19:42 then do another our actions have to fit
19:44 

19:44 with what we are trying to promote right
19:48 

19:48 um so I think it it's if we're not there
19:50 

19:50 today I I think it's up to us also to be
19:54 

19:54 more vocal about that yeah listen to
19:58 

19:58 this podcast
19:59 

19:59 by listening to this podcast yeah I love
20:01 

20:01 how like you talk about how you
20:03 

20:03 proactively communicate I think that's
20:05 

20:05 the thing like um right now we're still
20:08 

20:08 just trying to recognize more women
20:11 

20:11 intact and you know trying to like have
20:14 

20:14 a system that can support women
20:16 

20:16 especially like those who just became
20:18 

20:18 parents and still struggling finding
20:20 

20:20 their way back into jobs so I think you
20:24 

20:24 really emphasize it clearly that it's
20:26 

20:26 about proactively communicating your
20:27 

20:27 intentions hey I'm actually ready to go
20:29 

20:29 back to it and not assigning yourself a
20:31 

20:31 label that says I'm actually a new
20:33 

20:33 parent and you kind of have to be
20:35 

20:35 professional about it at the same time
20:36 

20:36 so I really like what you said about
20:38 

20:38 that and actually I want to mention you
20:40 

20:40 did write a blog post did not finish
20:42 

20:42 that blog post I did not I have it like
20:44 

20:44 in draft still but you did publish one
20:47 

20:47 before right uh I don't know if it's
20:49 

20:49 published it's probably still draft
20:51 

20:51 maybe this will motivate me too if
20:52 

20:52 people are interested comment in there
20:55 

20:55 and I will publish it right yeah cuz I
20:57 

20:57 think there's so much to elaborate on
20:58 

20:58 like like you know the similarities
21:00 

21:00 between parenting and Engineering just
21:03 

21:03 the two points that you mentioned I
21:04 

21:04 think you know that it's already so much
21:07 

21:07 learning that people can take away I
21:08 

21:08 think people definitely underestimate
21:10 

21:10 how similar parenting and Engineering is
21:13 

21:13 and the fact that since you're playing
21:14 

21:14 both roles you get to you know find
21:16 

21:16 similarities and learn from both sides I
21:18 

21:18 think that's something that many people
21:20 

21:20 want to read about so if you ever want
21:22 

21:22 to I will I will this will be my
21:24 

21:24 motivation yes I I love it that you know
21:26 

21:26 being a mom has also elevated you in
21:28 

21:28 your professional life like it's
21:30 

21:30 actually making you smart work smarter
21:33 

21:33 and like you know think in that
21:34 

21:34 particular Manner and handle things
21:36 

21:36 handle changes all the time handle curve
21:38 

21:38 balls thrown at you I feel like every
21:41 

21:41 episode we will learn a lot of things
21:43 

21:43 from you and I hope our audience also
21:45 

21:45 learn a lot from you yes so just to wrap
21:48 

21:48 up I think being a mom being an engineer
21:51 

21:51 no matter which role you are like
21:52 

21:52 there's always something that you will
21:54 

21:54 learn from something that you can um
21:57 

21:57 kind of apply to the roles each other
21:60 

21:60 and you also mentioned how it's
22:02 

22:02 difficult to
22:03 

22:03 compartmentalize yeah but eventually you
22:06 

22:06 figure out how to set boundaries set
22:08 

22:08 expectations and I think above all is
22:10 

22:10 you mentioned how you vocalize that cuz
22:12 

22:12 I think a lot of people in the workplace
22:14 

22:14 they just in our culture it's like we
22:16 

22:16 have to kind of be quiet and like just
22:19 

22:19 do our best silently but we don't
22:21 

22:21 vocalize then no one will know like if
22:22 

22:22 we're struggling or if we need help so I
22:25 

22:25 think you emphasize a lot about
22:26 

22:26 vocalizing which is something that I
22:29 

22:29 need to learn as well so once again
22:31 

22:31 always learn a lot from you so thank you
22:33 

22:33 so much I think I I will I will add one
22:36 

22:36 thing earlier the first question was
22:38 

22:38 like the term mom Jer and we talked
22:40 

22:40 about playing the engineering role and
22:42 

22:42 the mom role mom Jer combines the two
22:45 

22:45 and I think like when you Embrace that I
22:47 

22:47 personally am embracing that and you
22:49 

22:49 know you see the parallels at work then
22:51 

22:51 it's more fun I I just have more fun now
22:53 

22:53 that knowing that I can be both at the
22:55 

22:55 same time and I am both it's both of my
22:57 

22:57 identities so yeah I think think I would
22:59 

22:59 encourage anyone who feels that they are
23:01 

23:01 struggling with that to reach out like I
23:04 

23:04 am more than happy to at least provide
23:06 

23:06 some ways that I cope with it as well
23:09 

23:09 okay yes we'll definitely link all of um
