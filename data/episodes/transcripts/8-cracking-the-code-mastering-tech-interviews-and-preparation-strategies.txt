00:01 recording
00:07 

00:07 recording
00:09 

00:09 okaying the water oh yeah sorry I'm so
00:14 

00:14 unprepared to this so
00:16 

00:16 [Music]
00:19 

00:19 sorry hi welcome to R Tech the place for
00:21 

00:21 bites and bentor my name is Victoria I'm
00:23 

00:23 a Solutions engineer I'm selon software
00:26 

00:26 developer and I'm Natasha software
00:27 

00:27 engineer as well so in today's episode
00:30 

00:30 we'll be talking about interview prep
00:31 

00:31 resume tips and basically preparation
00:33 

00:33 for anyone who's like starting a career
00:35 

00:35 in Tech so maybe we can start with the
00:38 

00:38 both of you all right like yeah what do
00:40 

00:40 I what do we think about it yeah what
00:42 

00:42 what do you think about interview prep
00:44 

00:44 in general and like you know how in
00:45 

00:45 software Engineers there's like a huge
00:47 

00:47 competition for like you know data
00:49 

00:49 structures and algorithms and all that
00:51 

00:51 like how do you usually advise people to
00:54 

00:54 prep their interviews for for their
00:57 

00:57 career yeah maybe I can start with like
00:60 

00:60 how I do it maybe yeah in fact like
01:02 

01:02 maybe you should talk about how you
01:03 

01:03 actually have a series and that's why
01:05 

01:05 like I feel like you're the most
01:05 

01:05 qualified person to speak in this like
01:07 

01:07 room so yeah you want to talk a bit
01:09 

01:09 about that and how you've been helping
01:11 

01:11 others like prepare as well okay so uh
01:15 

01:15 how it all starts is basically for a
01:18 

01:18 software developer interviewing is like
01:21 

01:21 a big thing I feel like there are like
01:23 

01:23 five rounds in most companies and so
01:26 

01:26 there's like the the live coding round
01:30 

01:30 yeah so that that might be online where
01:32 

01:32 you have to answer data structures and
01:35 

01:35 algorithms question and then there would
01:37 

01:37 be a system Design Round so as you get a
01:39 

01:39 bit more senior there is the system
01:41 

01:41 design or there's the API Design Round
01:43 

01:43 for a more Junior role there might be
01:45 

01:45 like a behavioral round and uh some
01:48 

01:48 other cultural rounds and things like
01:50 

01:50 that so there are these rounds it is
01:52 

01:52 very difficult I in my opinion to
01:55 

01:55 prepare for this cuz you don't actually
01:57 

01:57 do these data structure algorithm
01:59 

01:59 questions in your dayto day job so you
02:01 

02:01 actually have to sit down on like this
02:03 

02:03 website I use lead code but it's like
02:05 

02:05 Hecker Hecker Hecker heer Hecker Rank
02:08 

02:08 and rank Hecker rank yeah yeah so uh you
02:13 

02:13 can prepare for questions on these but
02:16 

02:16 preparing is like basically relearning
02:18 

02:18 your whole
02:19 

02:19 university not your whole university but
02:21 

02:21 a lot of your University topics yeah
02:23 

02:23 it's very Tex I feel like it it'll take
02:26 

02:26 like 3 months for for me to for example
02:28 

02:28 if I've never I've not done an interview
02:31 

02:31 in a long time I it would take 3 months
02:33 

02:33 for me to prepare for the data
02:36 

02:36 structures and algorithm round for any
02:38 

02:38 bigger company and it's a whole process
02:40 

02:40 so what I usually do is I try to be
02:43 

02:43 consistent with it so always be
02:45 

02:45 interview ready basically and you know
02:48 

02:48 how the job market is Tech layoffs are
02:50 

02:50 going left right center everywhere so
02:52 

02:52 it's better to be interview ready and
02:55 

02:55 how you do that is basically how I do
02:57 

02:57 that is because I run a community I can
02:59 

02:59 do it so I actually do like monthly
03:02 

03:02 sessions uh every yeah so monthly
03:05 

03:05 sessions on like one question at a time
03:07 

03:07 or one system design Topic at a time
03:11 

03:11 where I will try to be I will be
03:13 

03:13 interviewed or I'll interview one of my
03:15 

03:15 friends and we'll just discuss around
03:18 

03:18 those topics and that's how we keep
03:20 

03:20 updated with uh the latest questions and
03:23 

03:23 be prepared with all the algorithms out
03:25 

03:25 there and yeah so it makes it a bit
03:27 

03:27 easier so when you're not pressured to
03:29 

03:29 go find for a job just on your normal
03:32 

03:32 daytoday life you're prepared already so
03:34 

03:34 that when you do get laid off yeah you
03:36 

03:36 will still have to practice a bit more
03:38 

03:38 but at least you're already like halfway
03:40 

03:40 there in that you don't have to like
03:42 

03:42 start from scratch yeah so that's that's
03:44 

03:44 my thinking overall for interview
03:46 

03:46 software developer interview prep but of
03:48 

03:48 course there's other parts of it like
03:49 

03:49 your resume has to be updated LinkedIn
03:52 

03:52 and things like that uh yeah so that
03:55 

03:55 that's how M my thinking is for soft I
03:59 

03:59 actually love that philos opy like
04:00 

04:00 always be interview ready cuz you don't
04:02 

04:02 know what happens like the same thing
04:05 

04:05 for resume actually I always tell my
04:06 

04:06 readers your resume has always to be
04:08 

04:08 interview ready kind of like ready for
04:10 

04:10 submission I I did write an article
04:12 

04:12 before on like you know how to structure
04:14 

04:14 a good resume there's a difference
04:16 

04:16 between good and W rums so I always like
04:20 

04:20 kind of show tips on how to have a w
04:22 

04:22 resume and one of those tips is actually
04:24 

04:24 to always keep it as up to date as
04:26 

04:26 possible so definitely in line with your
04:28 

04:28 philosophy I was wondering if
04:31 

04:31 Natasha yeah like actually I didn't
04:33 

04:33 realize that but I also kind of had the
04:35 

04:35 same mindset but less s of like really
04:38 

04:38 intentionally telling yourself I have to
04:40 

04:40 be interview ready at all times but to
04:42 

04:42 make sure that like your day-to-day
04:43 

04:43 software uh or like like your day-to-day
04:45 

04:45 work practices are kind of geared
04:47 

04:47 towards like different uh aspects of an
04:50 

04:50 interview uh I think one of the tips
04:52 

04:52 that people I always give to people when
04:54 

04:54 they ask me is really to be comfortable
04:56 

04:56 with vocalizing exactly what's in your
04:58 

04:58 mind and I think a lot of people people
04:60 

04:60 don't start off with that but this is
05:01 

05:01 something you can train on an everyday
05:03 

05:03 basis I.E engage in par programming like
05:06 

05:06 and when you're doing parir programming
05:08 

05:08 don't just like sit there and then just
05:09 

05:09 kind of like wait for questions to be
05:11 

05:11 asked to you uh by a partner um practice
05:14 

05:14 just like verbalizing everything and
05:16 

05:16 don't be ashamed of like um you know
05:19 

05:19 being like Oh I actually don't know this
05:20 

05:20 syntax like yeah you have to practice
05:22 

05:22 that as well because I feel like that
05:24 

05:24 went really well for me uh at a stages
05:27 

05:27 in life where I was interviewed but I
05:30 

05:30 would say that I wouldn't have had
05:31 

05:31 enough time to say like practice my data
05:34 

05:34 structures and algorithms to practice my
05:36 

05:36 system design questions but because
05:38 

05:38 every day I'm already so used to like
05:40 

05:40 just literally brain dumping everything
05:42 

05:42 that's in my head I felt like the
05:44 

05:44 interviewer could tell that I didn't
05:46 

05:46 prepare um uh for like exactly the
05:50 

05:50 questions but at the same time he knew
05:51 

05:51 exactly my thought process because I'll
05:53 

05:53 would be like oh um yeah I kind of want
05:55 

05:55 to do this but I kind of forgot like how
05:57 

05:57 to do it in this syntax um right now I'm
05:60 

05:60 going some of the um like interviews are
06:02 

06:02 like open book book as well and they
06:03 

06:03 want to see like what you search up I'm
06:05 

06:05 going to go on like the browser right
06:06 

06:06 now and I think I'm going to like search
06:08 

06:08 this up because this is the exact thing
06:09 

06:09 that I yeah so just basically um being
06:12 

06:12 comfortable with that being also knowing
06:14 

06:14 like the terminologies that you're um
06:18 

06:18 you use on an everyday basis to relay
06:20 

06:20 Concepts to people to relay your
06:22 

06:22 misunderstandings and uh relay like your
06:24 

06:24 questions and this also goes into like
06:27 

06:27 um not just being comfortable
06:28 

06:28 verbalizing what's in your head as you
06:30 

06:30 work but also the practice of like
06:33 

06:33 asking questions in work if you already
06:36 

06:36 have that practice where whenever you
06:37 

06:37 hit into a rope block you immediately
06:40 

06:40 ask someone you're constantly practicing
06:42 

06:42 ready you know verbalizing what's in
06:44 

06:44 your headp verbalizing your thought
06:45 

06:45 processes so that's kind of like
06:48 

06:48 actually in line with this whole
06:49 

06:49 philosophy of always being interview
06:50 

06:50 ready it doesn't have to be a very
06:52 

06:52 conscious thing in fact like once you
06:54 

06:54 start off it becomes very
06:55 

06:55 subconscious and I think that like you
06:58 

06:58 know with all all that wrapped up you
07:01 

07:01 know you have your resume ready you know
07:02 

07:02 you're always like practicing with a
07:04 

07:04 friend and also practicing not not
07:06 

07:06 really practicing data structures and
07:07 

07:07 algorithms every day like I think I
07:09 

07:09 would die like if I that' be so boring
07:11 

07:11 but uh and also like just in your
07:13 

07:13 everyday work um knowing how to
07:16 

07:16 verbalize your thought processes and
07:18 

07:18 being very unashamed about it I think
07:20 

07:20 that combined already you know you could
07:22 

07:22 be ready for an interview next day and
07:24 

07:24 you'll feel like really like um relaxed
07:26 

07:26 hopefully so natural at it yeah so what
07:28 

07:28 I actually like about you mentioned as
07:30 

07:30 well verbalizing the concept like
07:32 

07:32 practicing it I think a lot of people
07:34 

07:34 they focus on just deepening their
07:35 

07:35 knowledge and focusing on training like
07:38 

07:38 how to code like essentially but in Tech
07:40 

07:40 interviews we often see that they also
07:42 

07:42 test your communication skills and that
07:45 

07:45 is something people don't train enough I
07:47 

07:47 guess right and that's why we say about
07:49 

07:49 like mock interviews pair programming
07:51 

07:51 these are all essential because you're
07:52 

07:52 actually practicing how to communicate
07:54 

07:54 to other people so just by verbalizing
07:57 

07:57 your thoughts and your how you code your
07:59 

07:59 thought processes that actually kind of
08:02 

08:02 trains you and you're actually preparing
08:04 

08:04 for the interview so I really like what
08:06 

08:06 you mentioned about just verbalizing it
08:08 

08:08 out that actually like the examiner the
08:11 

08:11 interviewer they are actually kind of
08:13 

08:13 like looking whether or not you can
08:16 

08:16 communicate that exactly it's also a big
08:18 

08:18 part of communication yeah so like in a
08:20 

08:20 normal Tech interview they're not just
08:22 

08:22 looking at your solution but how you
08:24 

08:24 communicate because eventually
08:26 

08:26 especially for bigger companies you'll
08:28 

08:28 be within a team right they want to know
08:30 

08:30 how well you can articulate your
08:31 

08:31 Solutions and how well you can discuss
08:34 

08:34 and how well you can actually work in a
08:36 

08:36 team yeah so I think that is also one
08:38 

08:38 tip that would like to share with a lot
08:41 

08:41 of people is the communication skills
08:43 

08:43 part exactly and as you talk about that
08:45 

08:45 I wanted to throw something out I just
08:46 

08:46 realized like especially with things
08:48 

08:48 like chat gbt GitHub co-pilot all these
08:50 

08:50 like AI enabl like tools that basically
08:53 

08:53 replaces the mundane of I know like this
08:56 

08:56 stack in and out and I can I know all
08:59 

08:59 the syntax it's like you're basically
09:00 

09:00 weeding out like the people who already
09:03 

09:03 like know this so beyond like just being
09:06 

09:06 able to do what chat GPT what gith up
09:08 

09:08 co-pilot can do what can like um like
09:11 

09:11 interviewees and uh like people in Tech
09:13 

09:13 offer to the table now like what do you
09:16 

09:16 guys think oh actually when when you
09:18 

09:18 started talking about Chad G I thought
09:19 

09:19 you will be coming from the aspect that
09:21 

09:21 you should also be a good prompter
09:23 

09:23 actually I use Chad in my day-to-day
09:26 

09:26 coding job as well so to be able to
09:29 

09:29 articulate to Chad GP this is what I
09:32 

09:32 want can you write a method that can do
09:34 

09:34 this and then write a test for it or uh
09:37 

09:37 refactor this line of code so you should
09:39 

09:39 be able to know words like reflector
09:41 

09:41 firstly like or what is a good
09:43 

09:43 reflecting did they even do it properly
09:45 

09:45 or like understand the nuances that it
09:47 

09:47 does and uh to be able to tell it that
09:51 

09:51 uh what language what principle you want
09:52 

09:52 to use so that I think now the new age
09:56 

09:56 interviewing should also be looking out
09:58 

09:58 for uh
09:60 

09:60 you should be able to prompt cuz you'll
10:02 

10:02 be faster right cuz gith up co-pilot for
10:04 

10:04 example you should be just able to write
10:06 

10:06 a comment write this method and in like
10:09 

10:09 a second you already have a method
10:11 

10:11 whereas you spend 30 minutes to write
10:12 

10:12 this on your own yeah so that's also
10:15 

10:15 something so you should be using it
10:17 

10:17 maybe that I love that as like a senior
10:20 

10:20 engineer you are saying this because I
10:22 

10:22 think a lot of people are ashamed to
10:24 

10:24 admit that they rely heavily on GitHub
10:26 

10:26 co-pilot and chat gbt but you're
10:29 

10:29 absolutely right cuz like Beyond like
10:30 

10:30 doing the mundane and a routine that
10:33 

10:33 like these uh Services can already
10:35 

10:35 provide um it's about us and how we
10:37 

10:37 leverage on these tools to know exactly
10:39 

10:39 what to prompt that's like you know they
10:41 

10:41 call it a prompt engineer right like
10:43 

10:43 even as a like a a software engineering
10:45 

10:45 Solutions engineer you're a prompt
10:46 

10:46 engineer yourself and I like that you
10:49 

10:49 said you're basically thinking that
10:50 

10:50 maybe more interviews should be going in
10:52 

10:52 that direction to see what people prompt
10:55 

10:55 yeah yeah I think that's another aspect
10:57 

10:57 it it is the future of software
10:59 

10:59 development for sure that AI will be
11:02 

11:02 helping you to code and you will be a
11:05 

11:05 much faster developer so you should be I
11:09 

11:09 would actually look out for these kind
11:10 

11:10 of things I don't know about if
11:11 

11:11 companies are already doing it but I
11:12 

11:12 think that's where we should be going
11:14 

11:14 yeah agree it's not it's not something
11:16 

11:16 to be ashamed of it's something to be
11:17 

11:17 proud of that you leverage on existing
11:20 

11:20 Technologies to make yourself better
11:21 

11:21 yeah definitely I actually wanted to
11:23 

11:23 like bring about this new and this new
11:25 

11:25 topic which is I always find like for
11:27 

11:27 software Developers I always have like
11:30 

11:30 two opinions about this like why do we
11:33 

11:33 actually have to do those data structure
11:35 

11:35 and algorithm questions like why we
11:37 

11:37 going through this yes okay I didn't
11:39 

11:39 know we're going to get into that very
11:41 

11:41 fast but yes I want to know I want to
11:44 

11:44 know your opinions like what do you guys
11:46 

11:46 think about it I think it's unnecessary
11:50 

11:50 like honestly like it's not unnecessary
11:52 

11:52 in that like nobody should know data
11:54 

11:54 structures and algorithms but I think
11:55 

11:55 it's not necessary by practicing you can
11:58 

11:58 just do it exactly but why do we why do
12:01 

12:01 all of us have to do it yeah yeah I I
12:04 

12:04 think like I really think it's more of
12:06 

12:06 like it's an easy thing to test like
12:08 

12:08 that's one we have to acknowledge that
12:10 

12:10 in the job market um companies engage uh
12:13 

12:13 Outsource the recruitment part right and
12:15 

12:15 when you Outsource I realized that a lot
12:17 

12:17 of recruiters uh obviously they aren't
12:20 

12:20 Engineers themselves the majority of
12:21 

12:21 them otherwise they would be like
12:23 

12:23 Engineers um and the easy way around
12:26 

12:26 like testing you know um would be to
12:28 

12:28 look at what's already chesta in school
12:31 

12:31 right like for them to model um uh those
12:34 

12:34 those textbook answers and questions and
12:36 

12:36 I feel like that as a basis it's just
12:38 

12:38 more of like it's easy to test versus
12:41 

12:41 like system design questions you
12:42 

12:42 actually have to think about and know uh
12:45 

12:45 the system designed well as an
12:47 

12:47 interviewer you know as somebody who
12:49 

12:49 crafts the questions but as we're like
12:50 

12:50 interviewing so many people and hordes
12:52 

12:52 and people are Outsourcing recruitment
12:54 

12:54 to other agencies I can see why um the
12:58 

12:58 preference like you know know gears to
12:59 

12:59 where it's like easier to like test
13:01 

13:01 things so that's one and I think it's
13:03 

13:03 also like a weer you know um like like
13:06 

13:06 more of a weer around for people who
13:08 

13:08 just like completely aren't able to
13:11 

13:11 understand these Concepts perhaps I'm
13:12 

13:12 not saying that like uh I think this
13:14 

13:14 should be the continue to be the way for
13:17 

13:17 it I'm just saying like I acknowledge
13:19 

13:19 that you know why it's like this but
13:22 

13:22 whether or not it's actually important
13:23 

13:23 to our jobs um I don't think it is I um
13:28 

13:28 feel like it's it's more of like when
13:30 

13:30 you hit a problem that requires you to
13:32 

13:32 go down to that low level you naturally
13:35 

13:35 already have the resources to revisit
13:37 

13:37 those topics and see like what's
13:39 

13:39 important to that particular problem
13:41 

13:41 you're facing at hand in a job um yeah
13:45 

13:45 like for me I actually never had a data
13:46 

13:46 structures and algorithms class at all
13:49 

13:49 oh like yeah I never uh I never actually
13:52 

13:52 did like proper computer science and
13:54 

13:54 software engineering and I knew I didn't
13:56 

13:56 want to um basically like when I went to
13:59 

13:59 college I had the choice between going
14:00 

14:00 to Carnegie melon to pursue like
14:02 

14:02 straight up computer science and going
14:04 

14:04 to UCLA to do on declar because I don't
14:06 

14:06 know what I want to do I picked UCLA
14:09 

14:09 because I was so afraid that going into
14:11 

14:11 like computer science as Academia like I
14:14 

14:14 would completely be disenchanted and not
14:16 

14:16 want to pursue this as a discipline um
14:18 

14:18 so for my four years in college I
14:20 

14:20 continued software engineering on the
14:21 

14:21 side like still you know developing apps
14:24 

14:24 but I never actually like you know data
14:27 

14:27 science data structure algorithms
14:29 

14:29 whatever it's only like I decided to
14:30 

14:30 give myself a shot for Masters and I did
14:32 

14:32 a masters in computer information
14:33 

14:33 systems yeah and then like yeah I did
14:35 

14:35 the necessary to like pass and wave off
14:38 

14:38 like um the uh fundamental classes and
14:41 

14:41 stuff but do I think like those actually
14:43 

14:43 like help me in my current job I would
14:47 

14:47 say so yeah so I I do resonate a lot
14:49 

14:49 with you just also partly I don't have
14:51 

14:51 formal education in CS oh yeah uh When I
14:55 

14:55 Was preparing for like a interview with
14:57 

14:57 love tech companies the first thing
14:59 

14:59 they're looking for like you mentioned
15:00 

15:00 is to weed out is to filter the people
15:03 

15:03 who knows the concept and the people who
15:04 

15:04 don't so naturally I studied data
15:07 

15:07 structures and algorithms for like you
15:09 

15:09 know 10 11 months you know I studied it
15:12 

15:12 in Great depth because I know that it's
15:14 

15:14 important for me to know this if I want
15:16 

15:16 to get a job in Tech uh whether or not
15:19 

15:19 is relevant like in the day-to-day job
15:22 

15:22 is debatable but I do recognize it as a
15:25 

15:25 tool so it's kind of like calculus in
15:27 

15:27 finance it's like day-to-day job in
15:30 

15:30 finance you will need calculus but when
15:33 

15:33 things come and like you want to like
15:35 

15:35 analyze certain Trends or something math
15:38 

15:38 is needed so it's more like a tool it's
15:40 

15:40 like in the back of your mind you like
15:42 

15:42 immediately oh I actually know how to
15:44 

15:44 solve this problem because you already
15:46 

15:46 studied the concepts so it's not as in
15:49 

15:49 like oh you like some people would ask
15:51 

15:51 like people who never been in Tech do
15:53 

15:53 you actually use data structures and
15:55 

15:55 algorithms every day in coding of course
15:58 

15:58 my answer will be
15:59 

15:59 no but it's very helpful to know if like
16:03 

16:03 let's say you have a problem and then
16:04 

16:04 you need a solution you know what datra
16:07 

16:07 structure am I going to use to implement
16:09 

16:09 this so in a way knowing it is very
16:12 

16:12 useful and I can see why interviews
16:15 

16:15 always have this question is so that
16:17 

16:17 they know that and they are confident in
16:20 

16:20 hiring you that this these are the
16:22 

16:22 skills you have and these are the
16:23 

16:23 knowledge that you have so we're
16:25 

16:25 confident about you that you can solve
16:28 

16:28 problems like you know if the situation
16:30 

16:30 comes when you need data structures and
16:32 

16:32 algorithms yeah yeah essentially like a
16:34 

16:34 software doer job is to solve problems
16:37 

16:37 cuz there are problems but so like in my
16:41 

16:41 uh Journey what I've realized cuz every
16:43 

16:43 two years I do switch jobs right so I've
16:46 

16:46 done many interviews and from that
16:48 

16:48 experience I think like my conclusion of
16:50 

16:50 like uh this this rounds are is that I
16:55 

16:55 think uh it should not be the the the
16:59 

16:59 most biggest or like the deal breaker
17:01 

17:01 thing like I wouldn't ever like practice
17:04 

17:04 crazily and like be able to answer all
17:06 

17:06 questions I would be able I try I try I
17:09 

17:09 will try to keep myself to a level where
17:11 

17:11 I can answer medium questions not the
17:13 

17:13 really tough ones like go crazy so like
17:17 

17:17 able to answer medium questions and uh
17:19 

17:19 what it helps me do cuz I do interview
17:22 

17:22 prep on like on as a site thing also
17:25 

17:25 right so I actually think that it
17:27 

17:27 actually makes me feel smarter
17:29 

17:29 like I feel like I'm not oiling my
17:31 

17:31 engine what if you feel smart like it's
17:33 

17:33 you like your day to-day job you're not
17:35 

17:35 really using that much of your brain
17:36 

17:36 sometimes right sometimes it's cuz it's
17:39 

17:39 like uh repeater routine work sometimes
17:42 

17:42 so when I do this interview prep on the
17:45 

17:45 side it actually feels like I'm oiling
17:47 

17:47 my engines so then when I go to work the
17:49 

17:49 next day after doing like a two two
17:51 

17:51 three good questions the day before I
17:53 

17:53 actually feel like wait my brain's
17:55 

17:55 working a lot more faster it's like you
17:57 

17:57 know it's like engined it's like oil
17:59 

17:59 it's like that's good and then I
18:01 

18:01 actually start thinking a bit more about
18:03 

18:03 what I'm doing like actually uh even
18:06 

18:06 though it's like uh it's like you know
18:09 

18:09 you can use a set instead of like a
18:11 

18:11 array or like a list here because you
18:13 

18:13 want unique unique items you can
18:15 

18:15 actually you'll start thinking a little
18:17 

18:17 bit more about these nuances in your
18:20 

18:20 code and data structures you do use
18:22 

18:22 every day maybe not the algorithms but
18:26 

18:26 uh yeah it it does come in handy I feel
18:29 

18:29 in at work it does make me think a bit
18:31 

18:31 more think a bit more uh efficient wise
18:35 

18:35 as well cuz there are two for Loops that
18:37 

18:37 happens at work so then I will think
18:40 

18:40 about wait if there are like 100,000
18:43 

18:43 items coming in which it does in the
18:45 

18:45 company I work for because it's a bigger
18:47 

18:47 company so then I will think about I
18:50 

18:50 don't want to go through it uh two
18:52 

18:52 rounds of it how can I make it better so
18:55 

18:55 okay yeah true okay it does my words
18:58 

18:58 back it does it does make sense I just
19:00 

19:00 don't believe in doing the hardcore know
19:03 

19:03 how to answer all the hard questions
19:05 

19:05 kind of like know the names of
19:07 

19:07 algorithms things like that you should
19:09 

19:09 be able to solve questions it does show
19:11 

19:11 that you know how to solve questions you
19:13 

19:13 are able to think in that m in that
19:16 

19:16 sorry in that mindset so yes you should
19:20 

19:20 be able to think in that mindset it is a
19:21 

19:21 mindset I think the way of thinking it's
19:25 

19:25 a mindset paired with the knowledge
19:28 

19:28 correct yeah you should know when to tap
19:30 

19:30 what and solve this question in that
19:33 

19:33 manner uh yeah yeah perhaps what we're
19:35 

19:35 trying to gear towards is that we're not
19:37 

19:37 saying that data structures and
19:38 

19:38 algorithms are not important in fact
19:40 

19:40 they're the fundamental basis um and we
19:42 

19:42 do use it every single day but it's just
19:44 

19:44 that the way it's being tested as like
19:46 

19:46 pure data structures and algorithms
19:48 

19:48 rather than how is it being applied in
19:50 

19:50 modern um tools framework Stacks yeah I
19:53 

19:53 feel like that should be um like tested
19:55 

19:55 but I realize I I'm still kind of like
19:58 

19:58 um thinking about how it would look like
20:00 

20:00 so like I would I would if I'm an
20:02 

20:02 interviewer I wouldn't I wouldn't uh
20:05 

20:05 like beat about you're not able to
20:07 

20:07 produce the correct output I would look
20:09 

20:09 at your the way you explain this the
20:12 

20:12 pseudo code that you wrote or like the
20:15 

20:15 way you explained it to me I think if
20:17 

20:17 that is in the right uh Direction I
20:20 

20:20 would give that point to you that kind I
20:22 

20:22 don't think it should be so rigid like
20:24 

20:24 the output has to be correct if not the
20:26 

20:26 system will Mark you wrong and you are
20:28 

20:28 filtered yeah yeah actually that's a
20:30 

20:30 good point so um I want to kind of
20:33 

20:33 transition this into like let's say
20:35 

20:35 someone is you know just starting out
20:37 

20:37 their Tech journey and they want to be
20:39 

20:39 interview ready do you recommend them
20:42 

20:42 going into lead code and drilling for
20:44 

20:44 this kind of questions or how else do
20:46 

20:46 you recommend them to you know be more
20:49 

20:49 ready for these kind of interview
20:51 

20:51 questions so depends so there are some
20:54 

20:54 companies who do not ask you this
20:56 

20:56 algorithm questions they do exist they
20:59 

20:59 will ask you to create an app
21:02 

21:02 Y no algorithms involved their
21:05 

21:05 structures are involved but no
21:06 

21:06 algorithms are involved so depends what
21:09 

21:09 companies you want to join have that
21:11 

21:11 list look at the interview process check
21:13 

21:13 glass door they usually have what kind
21:15 

21:15 of questions they'll ask and prepare
21:17 

21:17 accordingly so if you want to get into
21:19 

21:19 meta for example then yes you need data
21:22 

21:22 structures and algorithms they're citing
21:23 

21:23 their first round but I wouldn't say
21:27 

21:27 like go crazy only do lead code
21:29 

21:29 questions for 3 months I think that's a
21:31 

21:31 bit and if and of course if you're not
21:33 

21:33 liking it don't do it there are other
21:36 

21:36 companies you can join you can still be
21:37 

21:37 a software developer but you should be
21:39 

21:39 able to do the easy questions cuz that
21:41 

21:41 is a test of your software
21:43 

21:43 development uh career right so yeah
21:46 

21:46 basically what I hear from you is first
21:48 

21:48 do your research so make sure you know
21:50 

21:50 that you know what are the companies
21:51 

21:51 that you want to apply to are looking
21:53 

21:53 for and you customize your learning
21:55 

21:55 method towards their interview questions
21:57 

21:57 so that's the first thing and then the
21:59 

21:59 second thing is also basically find the
22:01 

22:01 company culture that fits you right so
22:04 

22:04 it's not about you having to work for
22:06 

22:06 this company of course you work for this
22:08 

22:08 company but it's also if the company
22:10 

22:10 fits you right so it's like two-way
22:12 

22:12 process yeah you're going to be spending
22:14 

22:14 like nine hours in every single day in
22:16 

22:16 the company we should always be looking
22:18 

22:18 at the companies a bit more that's true
22:21 

22:21 strictly yeah like I mean uh I do
22:24 

22:24 understand in today's day and age it is
22:27 

22:27 a bit tough because
22:29 

22:29 a lot of companies seem to be firing and
22:31 

22:31 laying off like from news but I I think
22:35 

22:35 what is not shown in the news that also
22:37 

22:37 companies hiring I don't know why it's
22:39 

22:39 it's that way right I think it's just
22:41 

22:41 clickbait bro like seriously it's it's
22:44 

22:44 yeah it's more attractive to say that oh
22:45 

22:45 companies are all like retrenching but
22:46 

22:46 there are so many companies there are so
22:48 

22:48 many companies actually you don't even
22:49 

22:49 know their Nam the big Tech I would say
22:52 

22:52 so I think that's where you we should be
22:54 

22:54 looking at the mid tier company I think
22:57 

22:57 that's the name for it yeah I think when
22:59 

22:59 people think interviews they keep
22:60 

22:60 gunting for like big Tech yeah the Fang
23:04 

23:04 mang yeah but actually there are so many
23:06 

23:06 other companies that are in need of
23:07 

23:07 people right now uh and in need of like
23:10 

23:10 very uh specific roles as well you know
23:12 

23:12 that we can all explore um but a lot of
23:15 

23:15 people don't know about it because
23:16 

23:16 that's not like I also think that the
23:18 

23:18 majority of media out there where people
23:20 

23:20 you know they start the interview
23:21 

23:21 process and then youed click interview
23:23 

23:23 prep all all almost all of it it's about
23:26 

23:26 like how do I apply to m so I think that
23:29 

23:29 distorts people's perception and like
23:31 

23:31 restricts like their interview prep
23:33 

23:33 process it also restricts like their job
23:35 

23:35 hunt process yeah so that's why I I
23:38 

23:38 really appreciate that you brought that
23:40 

23:40 up there are a lot of other companies
23:41 

23:41 that are hiring that have very different
23:43 

23:43 um interview processes a lot of them are
23:46 

23:46 very lean companies as well so you have
23:48 

23:48 like the actual person on the uh feature
23:50 

23:50 team like interviewing you with very
23:52 

23:52 exact problems that relate to the
23:54 

23:54 position that they're opening up for so
23:57 

23:57 they'll be asking questions I like like
23:59 

23:59 the more more specific to feature like
24:01 

24:01 okay so we're facing this problem now
24:02 

24:02 we're scaling up to like 10 times more
24:04 

24:04 this is a current like database like
24:06 

24:06 what do you like recommend uh how would
24:08 

24:08 you like solve this problem and it's
24:09 

24:09 very specific to the feature and you get
24:11 

24:11 to know how the company that the feature
24:13 

24:13 team's culture is like you get to know
24:15 

24:15 what kind of problems will I be solving
24:16 

24:16 and you get to apply them so yeah I I do
24:20 

24:20 agree that uh different interview uh
24:23 

24:23 like methods out there depending on the
24:25 

24:25 company type but people just need to you
24:27 

24:27 know be open feel like that process of
24:29 

24:29 exploring I know that these exist yeah
24:31 

24:31 that's really nice I'm so glad like this
24:33 

24:33 is very insightful so far and I think
24:36 

24:36 just to add on so we talk about data
24:38 

24:38 structures and algorithms and like
24:40 

24:40 understanding doing research finding
24:42 

24:42 customized like the company that fits
24:44 

24:44 you and all that now just moving on to
24:47 

24:47 like the resume part right so it's like
24:50 

24:50 the written the very first entry right
24:53 

24:53 like how what makes a resume stand out
24:56 

24:56 like I want to ask that because at least
24:58 

24:58 in tech people will always ask do I need
25:00 

25:00 to make site do I need to build site
25:02 

25:02 projects and all that right what should
25:04 

25:04 I include in my resume people often ask
25:06 

25:06 me that and I just want to get your
25:08 

25:08 perspectives on this because I think
25:09 

25:09 it's very important to first get your
25:11 

25:11 resume in right because there's the
25:13 

25:13 first filter that's the first gateway
25:16 

25:16 yeah the interview actually comes later
25:18 

25:18 I'll be honest I actually do not write
25:20 

25:20 to create do not like to create resumes
25:22 

25:22 I've been using the same resume forever
25:24 

25:24 I just removed the bottom half add the
25:26 

25:26 top add a new job in with like a few
25:29 

25:29 bullet points so my resume is really
25:31 

25:31 basic but I do feel like I think we
25:33 

25:33 should stop making resumés or at all and
25:37 

25:37 just without LinkedIn cuz everything is
25:39 

25:39 already there at least for my I just
25:41 

25:41 updated in there and that should be the
25:43 

25:43 single point and I also only look for
25:45 

25:45 jobs which are on LinkedIn so like you
25:48 

25:48 know that one click jobs like apply
25:50 

25:50 while LinkedIn just one click and then
25:53 

25:53 my my URL is sent to them I'm like
25:56 

25:56 that's that's the aim like just just
25:58 

25:58 keep clicking on those kind of jobs so I
25:59 

25:59 don't even see the other jobs who are
26:01 

26:01 not on LinkedIn and who are collecting
26:04 

26:04 the paper resumes or something so but of
26:08 

26:08 course I'm speaking from a point of
26:09 

26:09 privilege because I was looking for jobs
26:12 

26:12 before the layoff started happening so
26:15 

26:15 at that point there were such companies
26:17 

26:17 I don't know what's the situation now
26:19 

26:19 yeah yeah but I don't actually do not uh
26:22 

26:22 think too much about like how my resume
26:24 

26:24 looks as long as the last last two jobs
26:27 

26:27 are there with a few bullet points of
26:29 

26:29 the achievements or like uh markers of
26:32 

26:32 what I brought in so I don't I don't uh
26:35 

26:35 dwell too much on how it looks like and
26:37 

26:37 what's side projects and stuff I guess
26:39 

26:39 you're speaking from the perspective of
26:40 

26:40 someone who's a senior engineer and who
26:42 

26:42 has job history maybe yes yes yeah what
26:45 

26:45 if they're like University students or
26:48 

26:48 someone is like trying to transition
26:50 

26:50 pivot into Tech then what oh do you I
26:55 

26:55 don't I don't know if the resume matters
26:58 

26:58 much in that sense is usually what what
27:01 

27:01 university what uh
27:04 

27:04 degree uh but of course now nowadays
27:07 

27:07 degrees are not also very important so I
27:10 

27:10 don't I'm actually not sure sorry well I
27:12 

27:12 I actually like um B I agree on like we
27:17 

27:17 shouldn't be using paper resumés anymore
27:18 

27:18 and go on LinkedIn because like that's
27:20 

27:20 just like an easier way the resume for
27:23 

27:23 us the paper resume yeah yeah so about
27:25 

27:25 that like I agree but uh in terms of
27:27 

27:27 like getting rid of that round of like
27:29 

27:29 looking at somebody's like either resume
27:31 

27:31 or LinkedIn I I I do think that still
27:33 

27:33 needs to retain but it's about like what
27:35 

27:35 are interviewers looking out for so even
27:37 

27:37 for University students or like senior
27:39 

27:39 Engineers um I think the resume is
27:41 

27:41 important for like the interviewer to
27:43 

27:43 look at I know what questions to ask
27:45 

27:45 like oh you had this job experience oh
27:47 

27:47 you had this extracurricular you built
27:49 

27:49 this type project what did you learn
27:51 

27:51 from it or like how did you implement
27:53 

27:53 this and um like beyond that like how do
27:55 

27:55 you furnish your LinkedIn a resume more
27:57 

27:57 to include include what you actually did
27:59 

27:59 so that you can prompt an interviewer to
28:00 

28:00 ask like more specific questions I think
28:03 

28:03 like one of the best tips I got uh from
28:05 

28:05 a friend who is a senior data scientist
28:08 

28:08 now um she basically said that every
28:11 

28:11 time she works uh on any project in a
28:13 

28:13 company she records and documents the
28:16 

28:16 process and makes sure she also like
28:18 

28:18 talks about the value to the team so
28:21 

28:21 every project she works on she looks
28:23 

28:23 back at her LinkedIn like resume and
28:25 

28:25 updates the bullet points under that
28:27 

28:27 like uh job so um that's something I'm
28:30 

28:30 also practicing as well as much as
28:32 

28:32 possible that every time I have a new
28:35 

28:35 change in job Focus or like I have even
28:37 

28:37 more clarity over what I'm doing I go
28:39 

28:39 back to like my LinkedIn and in the
28:41 

28:41 bullet points I update it uh and I try
28:43 

28:43 to gear that towards like what value did
28:45 

28:45 I bring to the team rather than just
28:48 

28:48 like um dropping like Stacks like this
28:50 

28:50 is what I used but um what what's my
28:53 

28:53 function yeah so because like with this
28:56 

28:56 and if you're continuously updating it
28:58 

28:58 it becomes easier than like oh now I
28:60 

28:60 need to look for a job you going back to
29:01 

29:01 like interview always interview ready
29:03 

29:03 always make sure your LinkedIn a resume
29:05 

29:05 is ready right remind there is a
29:07 

29:07 specific round for this as well where
29:08 

29:08 they just look at your resume and ask
29:10 

29:10 you questions of what you have written
29:12 

29:12 so make sure what you write is is
29:15 

29:15 important you know everything about it
29:17 

29:17 it's not just a fluke or like yeah I I
29:20 

29:20 used it like 10 years ago so I wrote it
29:22 

29:22 in yeah yeah and it's also like uh like
29:25 

29:25 to give examples of how those bullet
29:27 

29:27 points can look like you can talk about
29:29 

29:29 like yeah I was it could just be like I
29:32 

29:32 was a beckan engineer if and it's if
29:34 

29:34 it's just that it's just like oh okay
29:35 

29:35 but if your bullet points was like I saw
29:37 

29:37 through the companies like uh when we
29:39 

29:39 scaled up to like from just 1,000
29:42 

29:42 queries to now like uh 10,000 I was the
29:45 

29:45 one who implemented that solution you
29:47 

29:47 know moved and migrated us to the cloud
29:49 

29:49 to handle that that that sort of thing
29:51 

29:51 you know and then it gives like the
29:52 

29:52 interviewer that like insight to ask you
29:55 

29:55 like oh okay so you actually seem to
29:57 

29:57 know about how uh a migration of cloud
29:59 

29:59 and the uh benefits it provides like can
30:01 

30:01 you talk more about that yeah so that's
30:03 

30:03 that's kind of like how um like that
30:05 

30:05 that friend gave me insight into how I
30:07 

30:07 should structure the LinkedIn and resume
30:09 

30:09 or whatever and I think that's a good
30:11 

30:11 practice to have for University students
30:13 

30:13 though like uh I would say like focus on
30:17 

30:17 what you've done already like even in
30:19 

30:19 classes if you're doing like small
30:20 

30:20 little projects think about how would I
30:23 

30:23 reflect this in a resume and don't be
30:25 

30:25 ashamed to put that out even if it's
30:27 

30:27 just like you know a 7day um like
30:30 

30:30 project on building like some machine
30:32 

30:32 learning model yeah write about that
30:35 

30:35 yeah I think a lot of people are afraid
30:36 

30:36 and they're like oh this is so small and
30:37 

30:37 Tiny it's actually not small quite a big
30:40 

30:40 thing exactly just be confident and know
30:43 

30:43 that I have grown through have you grown
30:44 

30:44 through the process yeah so what how did
30:46 

30:46 you grow what were the problems you face
30:48 

30:48 like you should be proud of yourself
30:49 

30:49 first so that you dare to put that on
30:52 

30:52 like the resume you know yeah I think
30:53 

30:53 it's really good like what you mentioned
30:55 

30:55 the point about being specific so not
30:57 

30:57 just writing Your Role but adding that
30:59 

30:59 specific description and also the best
31:01 

31:01 practice of always recording what you're
31:03 

31:03 learning right another point I like to
31:06 

31:06 add is about like customizing the resume
31:10 

31:10 for the company cuz you know how like we
31:13 

31:13 we talk about you know doing research
31:16 

31:16 about the company to you know understand
31:17 

31:17 what kind of interview questions they'll
31:19 

31:19 ask so the same thing for resume like at
31:22 

31:22 least for me my process of doing my
31:24 

31:24 resume is I would kind of customize it
31:27 

31:27 to each company like for example you are
31:29 

31:29 a software developer but you can do web
31:31 

31:31 development and you can do mobile
31:33 

31:33 development so then you highlight the
31:35 

31:35 mobile part in one resume you highlight
31:37 

31:37 the web part in another resume exactly
31:39 

31:39 so that's what I mean by customizing the
31:41 

31:41 resume cuz I know when I was like
31:43 

31:43 applying to many tech jobs there's web
31:45 

31:45 developer there's mobile developer and
31:48 

31:48 there's one that's looking more for
31:49 

31:49 JavaScript there's one for Java like you
31:51 

31:51 know so you will have to intentionally
31:54 

31:54 highlight those and also highlight those
31:56 

31:56 achievements if you have any site
31:58 

31:58 projects built I literally have an
31:60 

31:60 example where I have before interviewed
32:02 

32:02 at this company and this company asked
32:04 

32:04 me about my site project like all of
32:06 

32:06 them cuz they find it interesting I'll
32:07 

32:07 like add a small descriptions on like my
32:09 

32:09 little projects you know and then
32:11 

32:11 they'll be like oh actually this is very
32:13 

32:13 interesting can you tell me more about
32:14 

32:14 it you know how you build it you know
32:16 

32:16 what's the process like what did you
32:17 

32:17 learn from it so in a way the companies
32:20 

32:20 they're getting to know you as a person
32:22 

32:22 you know you're not just another
32:24 

32:24 engineer like another tech person
32:26 

32:26 applying it's it's about really
32:28 

32:28 customizing it and also showcasing your
32:30 

32:30 personality in that resume to to stand
32:33 

32:33 out yeah that's personally how I kind of
32:35 

32:35 do
32:38 

32:38 it so I think today we like talked about
32:40 

32:40 a lot of different tips uh around
32:43 

32:43 interview preps so like software
32:44 

32:44 development interview prep and some can
32:46 

32:46 be applied to even uh other uh roles as
32:49 

32:49 well and yeah sorry do you want to wrap
32:53 

32:53 up can
32:55 

32:55 okay okay yeah so oh my God this has
32:58
