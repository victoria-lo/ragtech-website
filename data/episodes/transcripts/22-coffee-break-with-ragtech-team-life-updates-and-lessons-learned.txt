00:01 As I Grew a year older as you grew a
00:03 

00:03 year older Wier I always justed to think
00:06 

00:06 I'm timid when going out I'm not
00:09 

00:09 extroverted I actually like running on a
00:11 

00:11 high today was I actually like
00:13 

00:13 incredibly over stimulated like I didn't
00:15 

00:15 give myself time to do that and then
00:18 

00:18 January I felt like I just crashed and
00:19 

00:19 burn and but this time when I have to
00:22 

00:22 adapt it's every part of my life like
00:24 

00:24 work I would have to adapt myself to
00:26 

00:26 other people to the culture to um the
00:30 

00:30 pace of the work you you watch it yeah
00:33 

00:33 but we haven't gotten to the stage where
00:34 

00:34 well that people will be like oh so you
00:36 

00:36 have a podcast I'm like yeah yeah we do
00:39 

00:39 and then I'll just like sto there for a
00:40 

00:40 bit and so are you going to show me the
00:42 

00:42 link I'm like oh oh
00:45 

00:45 yeah Victoria had to do that she's been
00:48 

00:48 obsessed with that cap bar it's
00:50 

00:50 [Music]
00:54 

00:54 my Hello everybody welcome to R tag this
00:57 

00:57 is where we engage in bites and banter
00:59 

00:59 my name is Asha I'm a software engineer
01:02 

01:02 I'm Salone software developer and I'm
01:04 

01:04 Victoria Solutions engineer and together
01:06 

01:06 we are reag so today um we're just going
01:09 

01:09 to do a really chill catchup episode um
01:12 

01:12 I think when we were reviewing a lot of
01:14 

01:14 your comments and also like friends who
01:16 

01:16 have feedback to us personally they said
01:19 

01:19 they miss like the benty chill casual
01:22 

01:22 Vibes um because I think our previous
01:24 

01:24 episodes have been like we've had really
01:26 

01:26 amazing guest speakers who gave us
01:28 

01:28 really amazing uh advice across uh the
01:31 

01:31 the tech ecosystem but I think um it
01:34 

01:34 drifted to a more serious tonish and I
01:37 

01:37 think some people are like hey we want
01:38 

01:38 you all to venture again so we thought
01:41 

01:41 this would just be a simple little
01:43 

01:43 episode for us to catch up on each other
01:45 

01:45 catch up on each other's lives as well
01:48 

01:48 uh not just about like uh you know just
01:50 

01:50 in Tech but like outside of that um so
01:53 

01:53 we can bring the benter part of bites
01:55 

01:55 and vent back yeah well one of the more
01:58 

01:58 recent things that happened
02:00 

02:00 um was actually it was salon's birthday
02:04 

02:04 happy birthday
02:05 

02:05 Salone so I guess reflecting on like
02:09 

02:09 well I guess the year and your life in
02:12 

02:12 general because I guess every time we
02:14 

02:14 have a birthday we become sort of wiser
02:17 

02:17 what's uh something that you reflected a
02:19 

02:19 lot about like as you we're not going to
02:23 

02:23 reveal age but like as you turn
02:25 

02:25 something this
02:26 

02:26 year as I grew a year older as you grew
02:29 

02:29 a year older
02:31 

02:31 lot of things a lot of habits a lot of
02:34 

02:34 things that you think you're born with
02:36 

02:36 can be changed for example I always used
02:39 

02:39 to think I'm timid when going out I'm
02:43 

02:43 not extroverted but all these things
02:45 

02:45 actually are you can you can make
02:48 

02:48 yourself change you can make yourself
02:49 

02:49 extroverted if you want you can make
02:52 

02:52 yourself less timid basically that's the
02:54 

02:54 kind of realization or the New Growth
02:58 

02:58 thing that I learned fny how you these
02:60 

02:60 small things you only realize like a
03:02 

03:02 long so much later later like for you
03:05 

03:05 what was like one habit that made you
03:07 

03:07 realize like this fact that you picked
03:09 

03:09 up and you realize oh actually I can
03:11 

03:11 actually change this be work or personal
03:14 

03:14 things that worked well for me was
03:17 

03:17 affirmations you know and manifestation
03:21 

03:21 as well thinking of the person you want
03:23 

03:23 to be and then you kind of will become
03:26 

03:26 that
03:27 

03:27 person kind of I don't know which but
03:30 

03:30 level I'm going to that's good important
03:34 

03:34 to like that
03:36 

03:36 visualization I think that definitely I
03:38 

03:38 agree with that and I like how she talks
03:41 

03:41 about like don't stick yourself with a
03:44 

03:44 label that makes your you have like this
03:47 

03:47 fixed mindset like oh I'm always going
03:48 

03:48 to be like this right but it's amazing
03:50 

03:50 how like throughout your experience this
03:52 

03:52 year you come to the conclusion that you
03:54 

03:54 can have this growth mindset where you
03:56 

03:56 can actually gr out of that label over
03:59 

03:59 the years
04:00 

04:00 reflecting on my personality changes
04:04 

04:04 that has happened like there were highs
04:05 

04:05 there were lows and thinking about how I
04:07 

04:07 felt when I was on a high how I felt
04:10 

04:10 when I was on a low and then deciding
04:12 

04:12 that you know what I can actually make
04:14 

04:14 the most of my personalities by keeping
04:18 

04:18 myself on the high as much as I can and
04:21 

04:21 also accepting the lows and getting back
04:23 

04:23 up then can I ask how do you stay
04:25 

04:25 mindful of like your highs and lows do
04:27 

04:27 you keep like a journal or do you log
04:30 

04:30 that you uh I've tried different things
04:34 

04:34 and I'm still trying different things
04:36 

04:36 recently one of my friends she shared
04:37 

04:37 with me that uh instead of writing three
04:39 

04:39 things are grateful for write something
04:42 

04:42 uh good that happened to you that day or
04:45 

04:45 you know things like so every day you
04:48 

04:48 kind of reflecting the day it forces you
04:50 

04:50 to reflect and then that's how you
04:52 

04:52 realize actually today I was on a low or
04:56 

04:56 like today I was feeling this way today
04:58 

04:58 I was feeling good I guess after a while
04:60 

05:00 you do sort of see a pattern yeah wise
05:03 

05:03 words it's a newon newon wise I mean a
05:07 

05:07 year older a year wiser as to say even
05:09 

05:09 though I can see like the small little
05:11 

05:11 slony growing I can also see like
05:14 

05:14 the adultish
05:17 

05:17 Lear know child and then like the adult
05:21 

05:21 self I go for therapy and one of the
05:24 

05:24 Frameworks I introduced is transactional
05:26 

05:26 analysis and transactional Analysis is
05:28 

05:28 about recognizing the parent figure in
05:31 

05:31 you the child figure in you and how you
05:33 

05:33 kind of coales them to have like this uh
05:36 

05:36 adult self so actually that's kind of
05:39 

05:39 what you've been discovering you know
05:40 

05:40 the adult selves like the the adult self
05:43 

05:43 that's a co uh lessons of like the child
05:46 

05:46 and the parent perhaps parent was the
05:48 

05:48 word that you were looking for the wiser
05:50 

05:50 more mature and yeah but it's a very
05:52 

05:52 weird to call my parent child just me
05:55 

05:55 adult me small well in a way like for
05:58 

05:58 transactional analysis they do um it's
06:00 

06:00 it's both negative and positive like for
06:02 

06:02 example within the parent there's also
06:05 

06:05 the firm parent and but there's also
06:08 

06:08 like the that demands obedience you know
06:11 

06:11 the the parent that's overprotective
06:13 

06:13 that's always trying to protect you
06:15 

06:15 which um you know could explain a lot of
06:17 

06:17 people's like low confidence in self and
06:18 

06:18 how does this parent react to a child
06:21 

06:21 the child self that wants freedom and to
06:23 

06:23 a certain extent Rebellion so you are
06:26 

06:26 constantly having these conversations
06:28 

06:28 among yourself yeah so I think your
06:30 

06:30 reflection just brought to mind like you
06:32 

06:32 know my therapy session and just looking
06:34 

06:34 back like I think this year has also
06:37 

06:37 been a lot about like self-awareness for
06:39 

06:39 me um I and for me that awareness came
06:44 

06:44 from actually doing
06:46 

06:46 less L doing a lot less cuz I early on
06:49 

06:49 in the year I had a lot of burnout from
06:52 

06:52 doing too much last year I mean last the
06:56 

06:56 end of last year was a lot of great
06:57 

06:57 things we did a lot a lot of happen with
06:59 

06:59 women de and then like we also started a
07:01 

07:01 podcast right yeah a lot of exciting
07:04 

07:04 things but these things you know if you
07:06 

07:06 run too fast them um you start getting
07:09 

07:09 overwhelmed and this if you don't keep
07:12 

07:12 check like you don't every day kind of
07:14 

07:14 like reflect on like did I was I
07:16 

07:16 actually like running on a high today or
07:18 

07:18 was I actually like incredibly over
07:20 

07:20 stimulated like I didn't give myself
07:22 

07:22 time to do that and then January I felt
07:25 

07:25 like I just crashed and burn and I feel
07:27 

07:27 like I'm still in the process of
07:28 

07:28 recovery but like this is the the the
07:32 

07:32 the very stable phase where I kind of
07:34 

07:34 like know I've slowed down and really
07:36 

07:36 see stability in a lot of things like we
07:38 

07:38 now have a really good Cadence for this
07:40 

07:40 podcast I remember early on we were just
07:43 

07:43 running around still experimenting with
07:45 

07:45 a lot of things and we still have that
07:46 

07:46 like when we do our sync ups and then
07:48 

07:48 we're like this idea that idea oh my
07:50 

07:50 gosh we have to try this but actually
07:53 

07:53 consistency and that kind of like
07:56 

07:56 routineness is more important knowing
07:58 

07:58 that you know like now with we've not uh
08:01 

08:01 really had an episode three of us
08:03 

08:03 together for a really long time so this
08:05 

08:05 feels really nice and familiar like
08:07 

08:07 we're not you know trying to adapt to
08:09 

08:09 something new like the whole guest
08:10 

08:10 speaker thing was new so I think that's
08:14 

08:14 um leveraging on to your point about
08:16 

08:16 self-awareness like for me that
08:18 

08:18 self-awareness came from establishing
08:20 

08:20 routine and also
08:22 

08:22 appreciating um that when you let go of
08:24 

08:24 the things that are constantly uncertain
08:26 

08:26 changing they can be really exciting
08:27 

08:27 like you said but when you let go of
08:30 

08:30 chasing that what's remaining there then
08:33 

08:33 you realize uh what's the reliable
08:36 

08:36 routines you have in life reliable
08:38 

08:38 people for sure both of you are the two
08:41 

08:41 one of the two most reliable people for
08:43 

08:43 me so yeah a lot of like Reflections
08:46 

08:46 that way but yeah but for you I feel
08:50 

08:50 like this year would be quite uncertain
08:52 

08:52 went through quite a job transition
08:54 

08:54 different ecosystem different
08:56 

08:56 environment you're also flying quite a
08:58 

08:58 bit how's that for you this year I would
09:01 

09:01 say this year I would say is the year of
09:03 

09:03 um a lot of changes that's the key word
09:06 

09:06 this year is adapting I always thought
09:09 

09:09 of myself as someone who can adapt
09:11 

09:11 easily because I move to different
09:13 

09:13 countries and I always have to readapt
09:15 

09:15 myself but that's because I always have
09:17 

09:17 to it's easy for me to adapt because it
09:19 

09:19 was just concerning me so when I change
09:22 

09:22 to when I move to a new country I just
09:25 

09:25 uh basically I just adjust according to
09:27 

09:27 the environment but it's only on me but
09:30 

09:30 this time when I have to adapt it's
09:32 

09:32 every part of my life like work I would
09:34 

09:34 have to adapt myself to other people to
09:37 

09:37 the culture to um the pace of the work
09:41 

09:41 to the position so I would say it's a
09:44 

09:44 new type of
09:45 

09:45 adapting uh it's definitely not easy and
09:49 

09:49 there were times where I felt
09:51 

09:51 overwhelmed but I think one of the
09:53 

09:53 biggest lessons I learned this year is
09:55 

09:55 from humans
09:57 

09:57 episode yes uh but talk about like
10:01 

10:01 always finding your tribe and always
10:03 

10:03 finding people you can trust and people
10:05 

10:05 you can rely on so of course besides two
10:08 

10:08 of you I also managed to find the
10:11 

10:11 community that is woman Dev FG and I
10:13 

10:13 also be able to meet some co-workers in
10:16 

10:16 my new job that I can rely on that I can
10:19 

10:19 always ask questions without feeling
10:21 

10:21 judged or feeling insecure about so
10:25 

10:25 because of that I stick close to those
10:28 

10:28 people and I think that really has
10:30 

10:30 helped me grow and it just made me feel
10:33 

10:33 like I'm empowering myself through the
10:37 

10:37 support of others yeah and that's very
10:41 

10:41 rare for me cuz I always see myself as
10:43 

10:43 someone who do things well by myself I
10:46 

10:46 thought I was like even with school
10:49 

10:49 before with my work before yeah
10:51 

10:51 technical blogging as well it's like a
10:53 

10:53 very yeah it's it's always been quite
10:55 

10:55 individual and it's always quite been a
10:56 

10:56 long journey for me this whole time even
10:60 

10:60 my previous job was kind of working in
11:01 

11:01 Silo so it always feels like as long as
11:04 

11:04 I do my part well I always thought
11:06 

11:06 everything will be okay right um as long
11:09 

11:09 as I have this sense of responsibility
11:12 

11:12 everyone around me will also be okay but
11:14 

11:14 um what I uh learned this year is that
11:18 

11:18 you need to also learn how to be
11:20 

11:20 vulnerable um it's okay to share that
11:24 

11:24 with people you trust so I think I
11:27 

11:27 learned a lot especially from every
11:29 

11:29 single one of our guest speakers who
11:30 

11:30 come I always rewatch a lot of what they
11:33 

11:33 have to say and sometimes overanalyze
11:35 

11:35 like trying to yeah like thinking deeply
11:39 

11:39 about myself through their words and
11:41 

11:41 their insights and their wisdom so that
11:43 

11:43 is overall what I've been doing this
11:46 

11:46 year and yeah it's thanks to you guys
11:48 

11:48 that I I feel like I'm also like new
11:52 

11:52 salon new Victoria new Victoria all
11:56 

11:56 right like Victoria 2.0 right right
11:59 

11:59 let's interesting cuz uh you know
12:02 

12:02 because I felt like your job transition
12:04 

12:04 so far has been the most uncertain thing
12:06 

12:06 for you and you would like be like I'm
12:07 

12:07 so excited and stuff like that but
12:09 

12:09 actually it's brought upon like a a
12:11 

12:11 sense of stability and self-awareness
12:14 

12:14 that you know we both talked about um
12:17 

12:17 but in different context as for as for
12:19 

12:19 yours it's like birthday New Year like
12:21 

12:21 not much has changed but like you've
12:23 

12:23 kind of been able to look back and then
12:25 

12:25 see all the things that have happened
12:27 

12:27 identified like there were lows there
12:29 

12:29 were highs
12:30 

12:30 and then uh were became more self-aware
12:32 

12:32 and appreciated habits and routines
12:35 

12:35 because of that and then for me it came
12:36 

12:36 out of a place of well stopping and just
12:41 

12:41 like really appreciating the Mund in but
12:43 

12:43 for you that same realization came from
12:46 

12:46 changing and uncertainty U but it's
12:49 

12:49 great that we always come back to like
12:51 

12:51 you know the sense of community and
12:53 

12:53 self-awareness because I think a lot of
12:54 

12:54 self-awareness is comes from like um
12:57 

12:57 seeing mirrors and parallels as well as
12:60 

13:00 um foils of yourself like people who are
13:03 

13:03 different from you people who are the
13:04 

13:04 same and that's where the community
13:06 

13:06 comes in I think just thinking about
13:09 

13:09 that we've also built quite a community
13:11 

13:11 with our small little podcast here it's
13:13 

13:13 been steadily growing but it's so nice
13:15 

13:15 to be able to like at least in the
13:17 

13:17 context of Singapore and our little
13:19 

13:19 events out there but people start saying
13:21 

13:21 like yeah thank you so much for like uh
13:23

13:51 it for sure yeah definitely need to like
13:53 

13:53 know being able to express my opinions
13:55 

13:55 thinking about things learning from our
13:57 

13:57 guest speakers like imagine if we did
13:60 

14:00 not have the chance to ask them
14:02 

14:02 questions learn from them would we be
14:05 

14:05 actually watching some other podcast to
14:07 

14:07 learn things from people like this is
14:09 

14:09 kind of like we are forced to learn
14:11 

14:11 things from like not not forced but like
14:14 

14:14 we're there you know we we get the
14:15 

14:15 chance to learn it for me it gives us a
14:18 

14:18 reason to talk to it kind of cuz as
14:21 

14:21 someone who's like I'm not really sure
14:23

14:34 episode um just as sharing about things
14:37 

14:37 like noticed that we didn't really talk
14:38 

14:38 a lot about tech I think and then when
14:41 

14:41 we reflect you know we're not just like
14:42 

14:42 reflecting on my journey as a softare
14:44 

14:44 engineer like I think what we wanted to
14:46 

14:46 bring out in the first place that you
14:47 

14:47 know um that we are more and Beyond Tech
14:51 

14:51 it's about the realities of life that
14:53 

14:53 despite that being our job and there's a
14:56 

14:56 lot of nice exciting things happening
14:58 

14:58 there at the end of the day we are are
14:59 

14:59 human beings just like everybody else um
15:02 

15:02 we want ourselves to be relat Rel
15:05 

15:05 relatable as well as the industry that
