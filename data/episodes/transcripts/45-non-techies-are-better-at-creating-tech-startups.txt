00:00 We have to admit that the tech market is
00:02 

00:02 paying more than a lot of other job
00:04 

00:04 fields right now. So if we are saying
00:06 

00:06 non techies who otherwise aren't in the
00:07 

00:07 tech job market doing this startup
00:10 

00:10 versus me taking a entry-level job that
00:13 

00:13 might be 3 4K at best
00:15 

00:15 >> the opportunity cost is just simply not
00:17 

00:17 that high.
00:20 

00:20 [music]
00:24 

00:24 Hello everybody, we're Rack Tag. This is
00:26 

00:26 the podcast where we talk about real
00:27 

00:27 life in tech together with real people
00:29 

00:29 in tech. And my name is Natasha. I'm a
00:31 

00:31 software engineer.
00:32 

00:32 >> I'm Salon, software developer.
00:34 

00:34 >> And I'm Victoria, solutions engineer.
00:36 

00:36 >> And together we are rack tech. So
00:38 

00:38 today's episode uh is more of uh less of
00:41 

00:41 a topic but more of an observation that
00:43 

00:43 we've had. Three of us are techies.
00:45 

00:45 Three of us have worked in different
00:47 

00:47 companies. Three of us are also very
00:48 

00:48 active in uh the startup and founder
00:51 

00:51 community. And the other day um Salony
00:54 

00:54 and I I don't know what context we were
00:56 

00:56 in. We were basically looking at some
00:58 

00:58 other founders and talking to some other
00:60 

00:60 founders and she made this observation
01:02 

01:02 that a lot of non- techies are founders
01:06 

01:06 of tech companies and a lot less techies
01:09 

01:09 are actually founding companies in
01:11 

01:11 general. And we've been mulling over
01:14 

01:14 this observation and trying to talk to
01:16 

01:16 more people to understand why. So we
01:19 

01:19 wanted to have this conversation to kind
01:21 

01:21 of like be able to um get our thoughts
01:24 

01:24 in on this. So Salon, you came up with
01:27 

01:27 the obser observation. Um do you want to
01:29 

01:29 like talk more about uh when you started
01:32 

01:32 first uh observing this pattern?
01:36 

01:36 Uh I mean I I had been observing but it
01:39 

01:39 really hit me when I met this founder
01:42 

01:42 and they had started a tech company
01:45 

01:45 which was very into you can you can say
01:47 

01:47 something like uh cyber security maybe.
01:51 

01:51 So cyber security is a very niche field
01:53 

01:53 in tech right for that even I would not
01:56 

01:56 have like deep details about it but I
01:59 

01:59 would know like a beginner level basics
02:01 

02:01 of cyber security but for a
02:04 

02:04 non-technical person to be able to start
02:07 

02:07 a technical company on cyber security
02:10 

02:10 and cyber solution solutions it was very
02:14 

02:14 uh eye openening for me that okay you
02:16 

02:16 don't really need to know the details or
02:18 

02:18 the the deep knowledge in tech about
02:21 

02:21 cyber security, but you can still have
02:23 

02:23 an idea of a solution out there and just
02:27 

02:27 do it.
02:28 

02:28 >> Yeah. Yeah.
02:29 

02:29 >> And I was like, I have a lot of tech
02:31 

02:31 knowledge. Why can't I start a company?
02:34 

02:34 >> Yeah. Yeah. I think maybe we can start
02:36 

02:36 first at like how do we as techies um
02:41 

02:41 see the world and how do we function?
02:43 

02:43 You know, it it seems like we are it's
02:46 

02:46 the Dunning Krueger effect. you know,
02:48 

02:48 the more you know, the uh the the less
02:51 

02:51 confident you are about that subject uh
02:54 

02:54 matter. How do you think like this might
02:56 

02:56 connect to why techies might be more
02:58 

02:58 averse to jumping into a field that they
03:00 

03:00 don't really know?
03:02 

03:02 >> So, this is also by pure observation,
03:04 

03:04 but technical people are a little bit
03:07 

03:07 more risk averse is because partly like
03:10 

03:10 you said the Dunning Krueger effect is
03:12 

03:12 because the more you know, the more you
03:14 

03:14 know that you don't know. So you realize
03:17 

03:17 that there's so many things that you
03:18 

03:18 don't know about in this field like
03:20 

03:20 let's say you are already like a 5 years
03:23 

03:23 into cyber security compared to average
03:26 

03:26 people you definitely know more but you
03:28 

03:28 see yourself like I am nowhere near
03:30 

03:30 someone who has 10 years 20 years in
03:33 

03:33 cyber security so you know there's so
03:34 

03:34 many knowledge gaps that you don't know
03:37 

03:37 and that kind of that may paralyze
03:40 

03:40 someone from taking action
03:43 

03:43 >> and in general people are people who
03:47 

03:47 goes into tech I am just observing is
03:50 

03:50 they're risk averse in a way that they
03:53 

03:53 just want to look for stability and
03:55 

03:55 they're primarily motivated by the
03:58 

03:58 desire to learn to to master their craft
04:02 

04:02 at least that's from the different
04:04 

04:04 software engineers I've talked to a lot
04:05 

04:05 of them they see themselves in the next
04:07 

04:07 few years as a senior software engineer
04:10 

04:10 or they want to be someone principal
04:11 

04:11 software engineer they want to be
04:12 

04:12 someone who is a master at their skill
04:15 

04:15 But entrepreneurship is a whole another
04:18 

04:18 thing, right? It's something where you
04:21 

04:21 don't get to be a master of one skill,
04:23 

04:23 but instead you are wearing many
04:25 

04:25 different hats and you become a jack of
04:28 

04:28 all trade, master of none.
04:31 

04:31 >> Whereas I now see it techreneurship,
04:34 

04:34 right, are people who are uh jack of all
04:38 

04:38 trades and master of all. Basically, if
04:42 

04:42 you can position yourself to that level,
04:47 

04:47 um most likely you will be you will be
04:49 

04:49 able to uh be confident enough to start
04:52 

04:52 to start something. But that takes time
04:55 

04:55 and I don't think everyone starts out in
04:58 

04:58 that position.
04:59 

04:59 >> But the people who are actually doing it
05:02 

05:02 are the ones that are already halfway
05:05 

05:05 there. they're the ones who are already
05:07 

05:07 um willing to take those risk and
05:09 

05:09 willing to do what they see that there's
05:12 

05:12 a solution for a problem that you know
05:14 

05:14 even though they don't have much domain
05:15 

05:15 knowledge of
05:17 

05:17 >> so so I was saying like for me as a tech
05:19 

05:19 person
05:21 

05:21 >> uh and I do want to you know have a
05:23 

05:23 company of [clears throat] myself what
05:25 

05:25 is now stopping me from doing that is
05:27 

05:27 basically sheer
05:30 

05:30 uh fear of not
05:32 

05:32 >> no actually I have an answer I think
05:33 

05:33 it's opportunity cost for techies it's
05:36 

05:36 opportunity cost because you know that
05:39 

05:39 as a software engineer you're going to
05:41 

05:41 get like this salary that's going to
05:43 

05:43 this equity that's going to keep you so
05:45 

05:45 stable. So if I asked you right now yeah
05:47 

05:47 you want to be a founder but I ask you
05:49 

05:49 to quit your job right now and lose that
05:51 

05:51 stability of income in order to do that
05:54 

05:54 startup that you want you're probably
05:56 

05:56 probably not going to earn for the next
05:58 

05:58 two years would you do it?
06:01 

06:01 >> No.
06:01 

06:01 >> Yeah. as opposed to I bring you back to
06:04 

06:04 your university days, you haven't had a
06:06 

06:06 job yet.
06:08 

06:08 >> Do you think that what what is the
06:10 

06:10 opportunity cost there where you
06:13 

06:13 haven't, you know, progress in your job
06:15 

06:15 enough, you know, the opportunity cost
06:16 

06:16 is lower, you know, when you're a new
06:19 

06:19 university grad and then you take this
06:21 

06:21 uh uh perspective for uh non-technical
06:23 

06:23 people um where I mean we have to admit
06:26 

06:26 that the tech market is paying more than
06:28 

06:28 a lot of other job fields right now. So
06:30 

06:30 if we're saying non techies, techies who
06:32 

06:32 other non- techies who otherwise aren't
06:34 

06:34 in the tech job market, you know, versus
06:36 

06:36 this doing this startup uh versus me
06:40 

06:40 taking a entry- levelvel job that might
06:42 

06:42 be 3 4K at best,
06:45 

06:45 >> the opportunity cost is just simply not
06:47 

06:47 that uh uh high as opposed to you being
06:50 

06:50 like a senior software engineer now. Uh
06:53 

06:53 but that's why I also see that some
06:55 

06:55 people who are not willing to start
06:58 

06:58 earlier is also because yes they think
07:00 

07:00 of that opportunity cost but see they
07:02 

07:02 also think of it as a all or nothing
07:04 

07:04 kind of situation where like
07:06 

07:06 >> you you are limited to only doing one or
07:08 

07:08 the other
07:09 

07:09 >> where some entrepreneurs that you've
07:11 

07:11 spoken to they do it while they're
07:13 

07:13 having full-time jobs also just to test
07:16 

07:16 their idea first. So it really depends
07:19 

07:19 on your perspective and how you execute
07:21 

07:21 it. But of course it's very hard to say
07:24 

07:24 because people also have different
07:25 

07:25 seasons in life and maybe they value
07:28 

07:28 that stability right now over pursuing
07:31 

07:31 what they wanted to do and that's why
07:34 

07:34 it's very hard to say but I'm curious
07:37 

07:37 about for Salon who have always been
07:39 

07:39 like someone into entrepreneurship
07:43 

07:43 what has it been for you like and why
07:46 

07:46 why do you think you're starting you
07:48 

07:48 could you have started earlier if you
07:51 

07:51 you know met the the right people or
07:52 

07:52 like or have the right idea.
07:55 

07:55 >> Uh I mean honestly I have been trying
07:57 

07:57 for since I started working
08:00 

08:00 >> to start something. Uh somehow I from
08:05 

08:05 what I've reflected I think it's fear.
08:07 

08:07 Fear of failing, fear of putting in too
08:10 

08:10 much and again failing. Uh not knowing
08:14 

08:14 enough is definitely one of it because I
08:16 

08:16 don't know how to market. I don't know
08:18 

08:18 what I don't know in tech as well. I
08:20 

08:20 also don't want to pay people uh not be
08:23 

08:23 able to pay people because I didn't
08:25 

08:25 don't have enough income to do so. So
08:29 

08:29 yeah, basic I I would think for me is
08:31 

08:31 fear.
08:33 

08:33 >> And to which point like you did mention
08:35 

08:35 in university I would have lower
08:37 

08:37 opportunity cost because I don't have a
08:38 

08:38 stable income. would I have started
08:40 

08:40 something in university when I mean when
08:43 

08:43 I was thinking back in university the
08:45 

08:45 reason why I did not start in university
08:47 

08:47 is also because I don't know what it
08:50 

08:50 takes to release an app or market or
08:54 

08:54 talk oh one of the one of the years I
08:56 

08:56 mean while I was working when I did
08:58 

08:58 start a company I mean when I say start
09:00 

09:00 a company launch an app uh the reason
09:04 

09:04 why I gave it up was also because I did
09:06 

09:06 not understand
09:08 

09:08 uh seeding rounds and investments and
09:11 

09:11 pitching and there were so many new
09:13 

09:13 things coming up to me and then it gave
09:15 

09:15 me it made me more overwhelmed than like
09:17 

09:17 okay this is too much stress or you know
09:20 

09:20 new people coming up to me and asking me
09:22 

09:22 to be uh asking them asking me if they
09:25 

09:25 can be my co-founder so I'm like I
09:27 

09:27 already found it why would you be a
09:29 

09:29 co-founder now when I've already found
09:31 

09:31 it that concept was just like go yeah
09:35 

09:35 very foreign to me and I was just fear
09:37 

09:37 of not knowing things So I was like,
09:39 

09:39 okay, you know what? I will keep at it
09:40 

09:40 at my job. Keep learning, keep learning
09:43 

09:43 until I'm confident enough to do it. Now
09:45 

09:45 I'm realizing it's not so much about not
09:48 

09:48 knowing things. It is about I can now
09:50 

09:50 start a company and I know who to get
09:53 

09:53 into to help me do things. I think
09:56 

09:56 that's how non-technical people do it.
09:58 

09:58 They're like, I have a vision. I have an
09:60 

09:60 idea. I'll hire the best or I'll get the
10:02 

10:02 best engineers in to do it for me
10:06 

10:06 >> and I will have the vision of doing it.
10:09 

10:09 >> So I think that's how non- techies do
10:11 

10:11 it. That's what I think.
10:13 

10:13 >> Yeah, I think that's exactly right that
10:15 

10:15 nontechnical people they're not
10:17 

10:17 paralyzed by the fear of not knowing
10:19 

10:19 because by nature of not knowing they've
10:21 

10:21 had to ask people and they already know
10:24 

10:24 that they have the resources to find the
10:26 

10:26 people to do it. But as technical people
10:28 

10:28 you know we are so inclined to finding
10:30 

10:30 the solution ourselves. That's the whole
10:33 

10:33 idea of like software engineering right
10:35 

10:35 you just trial and error and then find
10:36 

10:36 it and be resourceful on your own. Very
10:39 

10:39 rarely do we reach out to other people
10:41 

10:41 to ask them for help in this field. So
10:44 

10:44 that's one. I think the second thing
10:45 

10:45 which I learned uh when I was in a
10:48 

10:48 venture accelerator in Boston for a year
10:50 

10:50 trying to start uh uh up a company in
10:52 

10:52 order to commercialize research I had
10:54 

10:54 done uh is that being a founder is more
10:58 

10:58 about owning the problem not the
11:00 

11:00 solution and for technical people like
11:03 

11:03 ourselves we tend to be more attached to
11:06 

11:06 the solution than the problem. That was
11:07 

11:07 how I was like I mean I entered the
11:10 

11:10 venture accelerator already with a
11:12 

11:12 solution. It was um this uh prediction
11:15 

11:15 algorithm to be able to predict how
11:17 

11:17 innovation would diffuse into industry
11:20 

11:20 already had a solution and it then I
11:23 

11:23 came in and I didn't want to let go of
11:25 

11:25 the solution. So it became more of like
11:27 

11:27 a let's find a problem to fit it. The
11:30 

11:30 the venture accelerator made me realize
11:33 

11:33 that um this was a much harder thing to
11:36 

11:36 do and I needed to detach from my
11:38 

11:38 product
11:39 

11:39 >> and start asking people and trying to
11:41 

11:41 find out what the problem is. So they
11:42 

11:42 made me basically stop developing and
11:46 

11:46 they said like talk to 50 people first
11:47 

11:47 then maybe we can talk about this first
11:49 

11:49 $1,000 we're going to give you to start
11:51 

11:51 things up. $1,000 only but 50 people
11:54 

11:54 >> you start talking to people and at first
11:56 

11:56 you go in with the bias of like I want
11:58 

11:58 to hear something that fits my worldview
11:60 

11:60 that you want to predict where
12:02 

12:02 innovation goes. First interview, oh
12:05 

12:05 wow, this person hardly wants to do
12:08 

12:08 that. They're actually happy with status
12:10 

12:10 quo. That's not good.
12:11 

12:11 >> Second interview again went in with my
12:13 

12:13 bias. Oh, this person is interested uh
12:17 

12:17 thinks it's interesting but not willing
12:19 

12:19 to pay a scent. And then the more you go
12:21 

12:21 to these interviews, you realize that
12:23 

12:23 the the issue is you coming into that
12:26 

12:26 interview with a bias of that person uh
12:30 

12:30 wanting your solution. I learned how to
12:32 

12:32 get rid of this bias and instead be more
12:34 

12:34 invested in the problem and finding out
12:36 

12:36 what problems people had. And I think
12:38 

12:38 like when nontechnical people they found
12:40 

12:40 companies because they know they don't
12:43 

12:43 have the resources yet to even envision
12:45 

12:45 what a solution looks like
12:47 

12:47 >> but they wholeheartedly believe and know
12:50 

12:50 that the problem exists. So they're
12:53 

12:53 going to like put in and go all in to be
12:56 

12:56 able to find a solution to the problem.
12:57 

12:57 And they're going to be very willing to
12:58 

12:58 pivot. Okay. Yeah. This solution or not.
12:60 

12:60 Let's drop it. Let's do the other one.
13:02 

13:02 That's what keeps founders going because
13:05 

13:05 solutions can go out of time, out of
13:08 

13:08 date, but problems don't. And I feel
13:10 

13:10 like that may be the main limiting
13:12 

13:12 factor for us uh and the wider
13:15 

13:15 engineering community is that we're so
13:18 

13:18 used to finding solutions, not problems.
13:23 

13:23 >> So, yeah. What do you think? Like that's
13:26 

13:26 something you've thought about like
13:28 

13:28 you've always want to be an entrepreneur
13:30 

13:30 but you know like do you start out first
13:32 

13:32 with a solution rather than like a
13:35 

13:35 problem? Do you find yourself like uh
13:38 

13:38 seeing problems more than solution? Like
13:41 

13:41 where do you think you're here on this?
13:43 

13:43 >> Uh definitely I I did know about this
13:46 

13:46 that problem first then solution but I
13:49 

13:49 think just because of the nature of
13:51 

13:51 engineering it does move on to the
13:53 

13:53 solution a bit too quickly. That's when
13:55 

13:55 you realize you have lost touch of the
13:57 

13:57 problem. And a lot of times for me what
13:60 

13:60 happened was I'll come up with a
14:01 

14:01 problem. Okay. Yeah. This is a problem.
14:03 

14:03 First I would not validate it. That was
14:05 

14:05 that was new that you you introduced to
14:08 

14:08 me like you know 50 interviews or 30
14:10 

14:10 interviews at least that that made it
14:13 

14:13 very real like okay maybe this is a
14:14 

14:14 problem to me not to others right. So
14:17 

14:17 validating that and then secondary
14:19 

14:19 secondly after you have the problem when
14:22 

14:22 we do go to the solution we try we'll
14:25 

14:25 see okay but there are other solutions
14:27 

14:27 in the market and that's when I would
14:29 

14:29 stop because the problem is already
14:31 

14:31 solved but no maybe that solution
14:35 

14:35 there's a reason why I didn't know about
14:37 

14:37 that solution for example or why it's
14:40 

14:40 not taking up as fast as other other
14:42 

14:42 solutions. So also doing market research
14:44 

14:44 on the different alternative solutions
14:47 

14:47 would also help to to find a gap of why
14:50 

14:50 people are not using this products.
14:53 

14:53 >> So yeah I I think it's still a learning
14:55 

14:55 process but I think it these are things
14:57 

14:57 that you learn as you go
14:59 

14:59 >> not you don't have I don't have to wait
15:01 

15:01 for things to pan out. I would see the
15:04 

15:04 entire thing.
15:04 

15:04 >> Yeah. Yeah. You don't have to like have
15:06 

15:06 taken a course have some kind of
15:08 

15:08 certification to do this this thing. You
15:10 

15:10 just have to have the resilience to push
15:11 

15:11 through. And another thing that you
15:13 

15:13 mentioned uh that I also noticed is that
15:16 

15:16 as software engineers or maybe techies
15:19 

15:19 like we tend to guard our intellectual
15:20 

15:20 property quite a lot where we because we
15:24 

15:24 own the solution, right? We're like I
15:26 

15:26 don't want anybody else to have this
15:29 

15:29 because you you were like you were
15:32 

15:32 asking me on this one idea I was avidly
15:34 

15:34 sharing. You were asking me like why are
15:37 

15:37 you sharing this idea with people? What
15:39 

15:39 if they take it? But I feel like that is
15:44 

15:44 uh not really a valid uh uh uh problem
15:48 

15:48 to ha to in the first place in the sense
15:50 

15:50 that ideas are cheap. Anybody can have
15:52 

15:52 an idea. Yeah, the idea can be like very
15:54 

15:54 creative and from uh uh like some kind
15:57 

15:57 of lived experience you have but it
15:60 

15:60 takes so much to execute an idea and
16:03 

16:03 bring it into fruition, you know, like
16:05 

16:05 it's it's so what you have this fancy
16:07 

16:07 idea. I could come up with 10 ideas
16:08 

16:08 right now in in the next 5 minutes.
16:10 

16:10 >> Our techy taboo idea.
16:12 

16:12 >> Our techy taboo idea. Sure. Like you
16:14 

16:14 know like these are just simple cards.
16:16 

16:16 Anybody could print these cards when you
16:19 

16:19 had the idea like you were also showing
16:23 

16:23 like you were playing it when it was
16:24 

16:24 just a paper prototype. Anybody playing
16:26 

16:26 with it could have taken the idea.
16:28 

16:28 >> Why didn't they?
16:31 

16:31 But
16:31 

16:31 >> it takes effort. It takes effort and it
16:33 

16:33 also takes uh a person who believes in
16:37 

16:37 the problem enough because of their own
16:40 

16:40 unique lived set of experiences. Like I
16:42 

16:42 wouldn't have related to your premise of
16:45 

16:45 like I I don't like small talk. That's
16:46 

16:46 why I created this. Like I mean I'm okay
16:49 

16:49 with small talk but you really saw the
16:52 

16:52 problem there. You saw that like wait
16:53 

16:53 all my friends in the tech industry tend
16:55 

16:55 to struggle with small talk and ice
16:57 

16:57 breakers are something that helps them.
16:59 

16:59 So you bring with yourself a different
17:03 

17:03 sort of passion and resilience to want
17:05 

17:05 to see through this because you believed
17:06 

17:06 in the problem. You didn't see that yet,
17:08 

17:08 but you believed in the problem. So
17:10 

17:10 yeah, the other thing that's important
17:12 

17:12 is finding the right people to do it
17:14 

17:14 with you to feel fill up the gaps, you
17:16 

17:16 know, and that's why, you know, you
17:19 

17:19 wouldn't have turned this into an actual
17:20 

17:20 card game if not for Victoria and
17:22 

17:22 myself. Victoria, you designed the
17:24 

17:24 entire packaging, right? and you came up
17:26 

17:26 with all like the little characters and
17:30 

17:30 the design and also the website to
17:32 

17:32 weight list. Like sure, you kind of
17:35 

17:35 could have done it yourself, but this
17:38 

17:38 was an instance of you reaching out with
17:40 

17:40 somebody with who was better at Canva
17:43 

17:43 and Photoshop than you who can uh uh
17:45 

17:45 design this. You know, I think people
17:48 

17:48 are the next most important thing for
17:51 

17:51 founding a company and is very hard to
17:53 

17:53 come by. a good team of people who have
17:57 

17:57 a very balanced uh skill set, you know,
17:59 

17:59 who not the same skill set but and
18:02 

18:02 different personality personality types
18:04 

18:04 with enough trust to kind of combat each
18:07 

18:07 other's thoughts.
18:08 

18:08 >> I would say the key word is
18:09 

18:09 complimentary complimentary skill sets,
18:12 

18:12 personality and ways of working and just
18:14 

18:14 good and open communication, right? I I
18:17 

18:17 think what I learned from this
18:18 

18:18 experience and and even how you started
18:20 

18:20 this was you really know how to
18:22 

18:22 communicate your passion like this is
18:24 

18:24 what I believe in and I really think
18:26 

18:26 it's a good idea. So even when it's
18:29 

18:29 still just a paper prototype, I remember
18:30 

18:30 we're recording one episode, it's almost
18:32 

18:32 just like this and then you're like,
18:34 

18:34 let's try it out, you know, like you're
18:36 

18:36 excited to talk about it. And I think
18:37 

18:37 naturally people can feel that from you
18:40 

18:40 is because this is your idea. And like
18:42 

18:42 what Natasha mentioned, ideas come
18:44 

18:44 cheap. And the thing is so many people
18:46 

18:46 are so busy focusing on their own ideas
18:49 

18:49 that they won't bother with yours. Trust
18:51 

18:51 me. So like I've been to many
18:53 

18:53 hackathons, right? Everyone really
18:55 

18:55 believes in their own ideas. They pitch
18:57 

18:57 it, they talk about it. Yours, they'll
18:60 

18:60 just listen like that's cool. They they
19:02 

19:02 won't do anything. They're too busy
19:04 

19:04 making their own ideas into reality. So
19:07 

19:07 that's why we always like at least both
19:10 

19:10 of us don't believe that this is a
19:11 

19:11 concern that you need to be worried
19:13 

19:13 about because definitely your idea
19:17 

19:17 technically is replicable of course, but
19:20 

19:20 how when when would you find another
19:23 

19:23 salon? Basically, you are your own like
19:26 

19:26 you are a unique individual and this is
19:28 

19:28 what you came up with. It's very hard
19:30 

19:30 for someone to replicate that.
19:32 

19:32 >> Yeah. Yeah. And it's just like the fact
19:35 

19:35 that we're still pushing through with
19:36 

19:36 this small little product, you know,
19:38 

19:38 we've hit obstacles along the way,
19:40 

19:40 right? Like having only like five people
19:42 

19:42 wait list. Oh, we were expecting 30. Oh,
19:45 

19:45 having uh like the supplier come in uh
19:48 

19:48 with dented uh packaging. These are all
19:51 

19:51 instances that if you give this idea to
19:55 

19:55 somebody else who didn't believe in the
19:56 

19:56 problem as passionately as you did, if
19:59 

19:59 they were to do it, they wouldn't push
20:01 

20:01 through with these obstacles. And I
20:03 

20:03 think that's the real value there. And
20:05 

20:05 bringing it back to like the initial
20:07 

20:07 observation why we see more
20:09 

20:09 non-technical founders than technical
20:11 

20:11 founders even in tech spaces. I I think
20:14 

20:14 it really is this that technical people
20:17 

20:17 um firstly we tend to obsess over our
20:20 

20:20 own solutions and ideas uh by nature of
20:22 

20:22 the job. Uh secondly, we're less
20:25 

20:25 inclined to reach out to other people uh
20:27 

20:27 who have better skills than than us. Uh
20:31 

20:31 and I think third we're also just not
20:33 

20:33 that good at marketing. I feel like
20:35 

20:35 business any form of company tech
20:38 

20:38 nontechnical physical product service
20:40 

20:40 it's all about marketing. you know it
20:42 

20:42 doesn't matter how good your solution is
20:44 

20:44 you know you need to reach out to the
20:46 

20:46 right people uh that's why when we
20:48 

20:48 talked to like one of the uh co-founders
20:50 

20:50 of this uh cyber safety uh organization
20:55 

20:55 and we asked her like you're a
20:57 

20:57 non-technical person like what makes you
20:59 

20:59 so uh confident that this business would
21:02 

21:02 have taken off uh and she was like
21:03 

21:03 through fierce networking you know I
21:06 

21:06 marketed it I tried to push it out and I
21:08 

21:08 feel like as techies like That is the
21:11 

21:11 one thing we struggle with a lot like
21:13 

21:13 marketing and reaching out to a broader
21:15 

21:15 audience. I mean, we're still doing it.
21:16 

21:16 We're still trying to learn. That's why
21:18 

21:18 this podcast thing is so hard for us.
21:20 

21:20 That's why the whole social media
21:21 

21:21 campaigns that we had to do, we had to
21:23 

21:23 try to find courses to like teach us how
21:26 

21:26 to do it. Whereas for I feel like for a
21:28 

21:28 lot of nontechnical people, it looks
21:30 

21:30 like it's intuitive.
21:32 

21:32 >> Maybe they also put in a lot of hours
21:34 

21:34 behind the scenes. We also don't know
21:35 

21:35 for sure but it's just my generalization
21:38 

21:38 but definitely they're more comfortable
21:39 

21:39 in front of the camera than you know
21:42 

21:42 like in more introverted people right
21:44 

21:44 and then we even have an episode about
21:46 

21:46 are engineers introverted
21:48 

21:48 >> and I think our consensus is that
21:50 

21:50 >> in general yeah yeah we agree they are
21:52 

21:52 and so that's why it's very hard for
21:54 

21:54 them to put themselves out there feels
21:56 

21:56 so vulnerable you know it feels like
21:59 

21:59 >> oh my god everyone can see what I'm
22:01 

22:01 doing like yes building in public is
22:03 

22:03 even something that a lot of software
22:05 

22:05 engineers are trying to advocate now,
22:08 

22:08 but not many people, it's still just a
22:10 

22:10 good minority that's building in public
22:12 

22:12 because a good majority likes to stay
22:16 

22:16 >> hidden.
22:17 

22:17 >> And even a lot of their GitHub profiles,
22:19 

22:19 they try to keep it
22:21 

22:21 >> clean. Clean and like
22:22 

22:22 >> green everywhere.
22:24 

22:24 >> Yeah. But no profile picture and no
22:26 

22:26 personal branding, you know, just just
22:28 

22:28 keep it as anonymous as possible. like
22:30 

22:30 their GitHub username is not their names
22:32 

22:32 but it's like something else
22:34 

22:34 >> it's because they believe like I don't
22:37 

22:37 know it's just the form of being
22:39 

22:39 technical person it's like
22:41 

22:41 >> you just be anonymous you know like it's
22:43 

22:43 fine not to be visible like they don't
22:45 

22:45 value that part
22:46 

22:46 >> I think it's not about like just wanting
22:48 

22:48 to be invisible as a whole but it's the
22:50 

22:50 fear of being seen failing I think like
22:53 

22:53 if this is advice to any uh technical
22:56 

22:56 even nontechnical people out there who
22:59 

22:59 uh resonate with the things that we're
23:01 

23:01 saying and I'm also seeing a lot of
23:02 

23:02 technical people who like us want to
23:05 

23:05 found companies especially with how
23:06 

23:06 volatile the tech market is you know
23:08 

23:08 people are starting to lose uh uh faith
23:10 

23:10 in having a stable job in tech things
23:13 

23:13 are changing and a lot of uh people in
23:16 

23:16 tech are trying to move to found
23:18 

23:18 something on their own like because like
23:20 

23:20 I said the opportunity cost that we
23:21 

23:21 talked about earlier it's actually going
23:23 

23:23 down because now you don't have the
23:25 

23:25 stability anymore to mark as like an
23:27 

23:27 opportunity you have to give up. So with
23:30 

23:30 more technical people trying out this
23:31 

23:31 route um I think the advice not that we
23:35 

23:35 are in a position to give advice but
23:37 

23:37 through our anecdotes and things that we
23:39 

23:39 have tried and failed in it which we
23:40 

23:40 hope that you learn from so you don't
23:43 

23:43 have to go through those bounds is one
23:46 

23:46 don't be afraid of what you don't know
23:48 

23:48 um Dunning Krueger effect is very real
23:51 

23:51 we know but at the same time like um the
23:54 

23:54 the fun is also in discovering uh how
23:56 

23:56 you're going to do this thing that you
23:58 

23:58 don't know just go into it, just do it
23:60 

23:60 and have solace in the fact that you
24:02 

24:02 will be able to find people who know how
24:04 

24:04 to do the thing that you don't know. Uh
24:06 

24:06 that goes to the second part. Um being
24:09 

24:09 able to uh network to share your ideas
24:12 

24:12 with other people is one great way that
24:15 

24:15 you can get to know this network of
24:17 

24:17 people who know what you don't know,
24:18 

24:18 right? And also market your product.
24:20 

24:20 That is how you do it. You know, it's
24:22 

24:22 not all about the solution. It is more
24:24 

24:24 about the community around the problem
24:27 

24:27 you're trying to solve.
24:29 

24:29 >> Yeah.
24:29 

24:29 >> And not just market a product, market
24:31 

24:31 yourself.
24:32 

24:32 >> Yes. Yes.
24:33 

24:33 >> Because most of the time brands are the
24:35 

24:35 person themselves.
24:38 

24:38 >> So,
24:38 

24:38 >> exactly. I think people buy products
24:41 

24:41 from people not from brands. Otherwise,
24:43 

24:43 like I could just buy any other thing
24:45 

24:45 off of like I don't know, Topout and
24:47 

24:47 eBay. Um but you know uh in this era of
24:54 

24:54 um a lot of creator-led businesses where
24:58 

24:58 people are putting themselves on social
24:60 

25:00 media and have like large following and
25:03 

25:03 then they sell their products in return.
25:05 

25:05 I think more and more people are
25:06 

25:06 preferring to buy from creators and
25:08 

25:08 individuals than corporates and brands.
25:11
