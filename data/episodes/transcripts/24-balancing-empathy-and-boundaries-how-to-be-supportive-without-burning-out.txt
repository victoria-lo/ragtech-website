00:00 back when I first ventured into Tech and
00:03 

00:03 I uh started off feeling like I was way
00:06 

00:06 more stupid than everybody else so
00:08 

00:08 there's this Dunning Krueger effect
00:10 

00:10 where the line will goes up and up so
00:12 

00:12 the more things you know the more
00:13 

00:13 confidence you feel as well as times go
00:15 

00:15 by you're not stupid okay you're you're
00:18 

00:18 not it's okay to be the not the smartest
00:21 

00:21 person in the room but uh I also want to
00:24 

00:24 acknowledge even though these are
00:25 

00:25 strategies to overcome uh imposter
00:28 

00:28 syndrome when the feeling does hit you
00:30 

00:30 it is completely like you say completely
00:31 

00:31 normal to feel that way I think one of
00:34 

00:34 the best things to do is to reach out to
00:36 

00:36 somebody who will not judge you um and
00:39 

00:39 to bring them you I think you do this uh
00:42 

00:42 really well you just literally like drag
00:44 

00:44 a person out I just need to bring them
00:46 

00:46 and organ trust that person I know who's
00:49 

00:49 willing to take the dump yeah yeah I I
00:51 

00:51 like that I think the last time that we
00:53 

00:53 did that together you she literally was
00:55 

00:55 like we were grabbing coffee and then
00:57 

00:57 she was like okay this is going to be
00:59 

00:59 super random not connected to anything
01:01 

01:01 that we did at all um but I just need to
01:04 

01:04 dump my thoughts and my feelings so I
01:07 

01:07 can organize them and I really
01:09 

01:09 appreciated that and I think a lot of
01:11 

01:11 people will be willing to be that person
01:13 

01:13 for other people too and I think it's
01:15 

01:15 also good not not everyone's you need a
01:18 

01:18 lot of Mind space to take someone else's
01:21 

01:21 dump right like you have to be free of
01:23 

01:23 your own dump first to be able to take
01:25 

01:25 someone else's in and then that's true
01:27 

01:27 if somebody else is also experiencing
01:28 

01:28 something that's why always asked like I
01:31 

01:31 asked you that's true that's a good
01:33 

01:33 strategy are you in a in a correct kid
01:35 

01:35 space to take mine in I really like that
01:39 

01:39 yeah everyone caring like it's more
01:44 

01:44 like the oh Mt oh thinking thinking so
01:49 

01:49 it's like someone can bring them meat
01:51 

01:51 and I can like give them Solutions but I
01:54 

01:54 won't be affected so so it's like last
01:57 

01:57 time you got before like send me a text
01:59 

01:59 right like brain dumping me before and
02:01 

02:01 then I give you all these quotes and
02:03 

02:03 these yes yes yes and then you're like
02:06 

02:06 oh that's good you have a away with
02:07 

02:07 words so it's like like I will try to
02:09 

02:09 help you basically if someone dumps on
02:12 

02:12 me I will find solutions for that person
02:15 

02:15 that's how I show care and then if that
02:17 

02:17 person's problem solved they like good
02:20 

02:20 it makes you feel good as well as as
02:22 

02:22 somebody who gave somebody that hit
02:24 

02:24 space the advice yeah but it won't like
02:26 

02:26 oh affect it won't affect you like you
02:30 

02:30 won't carry that baggage with you when
02:32 

02:32 you go home yeah something like that
02:35 

02:35 it's more like I'm glad I did something
02:37 

02:37 good like I help this person you know if
02:40 

02:40 I couldn't help that person during that
02:42 

02:42 session let's say like after we talk
02:44 

02:44 then I'll go back home and maybe I'll
02:46 

02:46 brainstorm like H how else like you know
02:49 

02:49 but that's you carrying the baggage oh
02:51 

02:51 but it's not like emotional okay I don't
02:54 

02:54 know how I describe it but it's not
02:55 

02:55 emotional it's more like I see it as a
02:57 

02:57 problem to solve so it's like I can pin
02:59 

02:59 it some other time I
03:02 

03:02 can this is is a segue from like
03:05 

03:05 imposter syndrome as a whole but I do
03:06 

03:06 think it comes hand in hand because it's
03:08 

03:08 also about like the strategy of
03:10 

03:10 approaching somebody who has the head
03:11 

03:11 space and now we're talking about like
03:13 

03:13 different people's approaches to being
03:15 

03:15 that hit space right and for you you
03:17 

03:17 said that um you're not you're somebody
03:19 

03:19 who just doesn't take the emotional
03:21 

03:21 baggage back home with you so you almost
03:23 

03:23 always have that hit space and time and
03:25 

03:25 she's like the perfect person to go to
03:27 

03:27 but for me I actually for in
03:31 

03:31 vioria because
03:32 

03:32 Solutions my readers always come to me
03:35 

03:35 with emails of problems every day and I
03:37 

03:37 just like oh the solution here's a
03:38 

03:38 solution you have Solutions this is why
03:41 

03:41 she's a Solutions engineer no this is so
03:43 

03:43 interesting for me because I wanted to
03:45 

03:45 segue into like being that the idea of
03:47 

03:47 being an emotional dumpster because
03:50 

03:50 there's two extents to it to being that
03:51 

03:51 reliable friend uh that you can go to
03:54 

03:54 get Solutions advice as well as just
03:57 

03:57 like validation but the other thing
03:59 

03:59 about work
04:00 

04:00 in a workplace that has a tendency for
04:03 

04:03 high burnout that for people to
04:04 

04:04 experience imposter syndrome often is
04:07 

04:07 that if you put yourself out there as a
04:08 

04:08 listener too much people might take
04:11 

04:11 advantage of that and you have to know
04:12 

04:12 your own boundaries because this is
04:14 

04:14 something I learned uh only this year I
04:16 

04:16 I did mention that I am a very highly
04:18 

04:18 empathetic listener and I don't mean
04:20 

04:20 that to be flamboyant I I just mean that
04:23 

04:23 as like it's a condition in the sense
04:25 

04:25 that I literally will put myself in the
04:29 

04:29 shoes of the other person and it drains
04:31 

04:31 me yeah and I bring it home with me and
04:35 

04:35 I for the longest time I did not know
04:37 

04:37 how to deal with that then you would
04:39 

04:39 have people saying it's a good tra so
04:41 

04:41 I'll be like okay I'll keep it but it
04:43 

04:43 was also eating me up inside the more
04:45 

04:45 people started approaching me because of
04:47 

04:47 the tendency of like this industry and I
04:50 

04:50 was just like I I also need to learn to
04:52 

04:52 draw my own boundar so now pivoting into
04:55 

04:55 the idea of drawing your own boundaries
04:57 

04:57 because it also kind of like leads in
04:59 

04:59 into if you're too mentally drained
05:01 

05:01 emotionally drained socially drained
05:03 

05:03 you're also at a higher tendency for
05:04 

05:04 imposter syndrome later on because you
05:06 

05:06 don't have your own hit space to just
05:08 

05:08 like take yourself out of that
05:10 

05:10 self-doubt and process I I'm learning
05:12 

05:12 how to be like that to just see that as
05:14 

05:14 like okay you're coming to me I'm going
05:16 

05:16 to act like I am solutioning for you but
05:19 

05:19 it's not going to affect my day-to- day
05:21 

05:21 I don't think I can completely do that
05:23 

05:23 yet what I am doing is just only
05:26 

05:26 allowing my hit space to be entered by
05:27 

05:27 people uh who I know don't take
05:30 

05:30 advantage of it and who also offered me
05:31 

05:31 that space that's why I was so ready to
05:33 

05:33 give mine to you because I know you you
05:35 

05:35 would have done your own self workk I
05:37 

05:37 have the Assurance because you're always
05:39 

05:39 like so self-aware and for you to come
05:42 

05:42 to me at that point uh I do realize that
05:44 

05:44 you really need to map it all out and
05:47 

05:47 I'm very willing to do that for you
05:48 

05:48 because I know you would do that for me
05:50 

05:50 but there are also a lot of other people
05:52 

05:52 who take advantage of the fact that
05:55 

05:55 you're an active listener and really
05:56 

05:56 just dump and then the next day they
05:58 

05:58 don't they don't contact you they don't
05:60 

05:60 say anything when you're in a rut they
06:02 

06:02 also don't give you that hit space and I
06:04 

06:04 think it's very important to identify
06:06 

06:06 these people uh in across your career
06:09 

06:09 and by career I mean both in your
06:11 

06:11 workplace as well as your outside
06:12 

06:12 Community my strategy is to draw the
06:15 

06:15 boundaries in terms of people but for
06:17 

06:17 you it's excellent that you're able to
06:19 

06:19 just like whoever it
06:21 

06:21 is no it's called
06:23 

06:23 compartmentalizing oh yeah so that's
06:25 

06:25 what you one put it aside okay you put
06:28 

06:28 it
06:28 

06:28 aside yeah you have your own head
06:31 

06:31 space yeah something like I have a
06:33 

06:33 different heart drive
06:35 

06:35 for myself and other people yeah like I
06:38 

06:38 usually people come to me and I can
06:40 

06:40 listen to them for hours with their
06:42 

06:42 problems that's why actually I noticed
06:44 

06:44 this but a lot of people come to me
06:46 

06:46 thinking I'm like a like a consultant
06:49 

06:49 almost but the thing is sometimes they
06:52 

06:52 also want like emotional validation like
06:55 

06:55 things that are more feeling then I'll
06:57 

06:57 be like I can kind of like validate a
07:00 

07:00 little bit like that but most of the
07:02 

07:02 time I want to focus on how to solve
07:03 

07:03 your problems like if you come to me so
07:06 

07:06 so sometimes like my more uh maybe
07:08 

07:08 sensitive friends would say I want to
07:10 

07:10 come talk to you then I say do you want
07:11 

07:11 Solutions or do you want me to just
07:13 

07:13 listen I think it asked me that one time
07:16 

07:16 yeah yeah oh my gosh the thing is with I
07:18 

07:18 that's why I learn mbti so that I can
07:20 

07:20 like cater to the person so if the
07:22 

07:22 person's more te then I know immediately
07:24 

07:24 they just want Solutions so I just give
07:26 

07:26 them solution but if the person's more F
07:28 

07:28 then I'll be thinking do you want
07:30 

07:30 Solutions or do you want me to just
07:31 

07:31 listen and people do like say that they
07:34 

07:34 want the former or the latter like it's
07:35 

07:35 not like because they will usually come
07:37 

07:37 to you but it made
07:40 

07:40 sense I was surprised cuz usually they
07:43 

07:43 will come to you knowing what they want
07:44 

07:44 from you like they'll come to you like I
07:46 

07:46 want to just braing them or they will
07:48 

07:48 come to you say I'm actually asking for
07:50 

07:50 advice so they already come to you with
07:52 

07:52 a purpose at Le at least in my case when
07:54 

07:54 they come ask me is because they know I
07:57 

07:57 I am me so they come to me with a
07:60 

07:60 certain goal so that's why I as what's
08:01 

08:01 your objective right you want solution
08:03 

08:03 or you want me to just listen so some
08:05 

08:05 people will just ask me to listen then
08:07 

08:07 I'll listen for like four or five hours
08:09 

08:09 and some people say yeah it has happened
08:11 

08:11 before and then some people say I want
08:13 

08:13 the solution and give it to me now so I
08:15 

08:15 said
08:16 

08:16 okay I see I see I'm almost like the
08:19 

08:19 consultant in the friend I say I'm like
08:21 

08:21 in between both of you actually like I
08:23 

08:23 don't take some people's emotional
08:25 

08:25 baggage but I'm also able to
08:27 

08:27 compartmentalize like cuz I do Val Val
08:30 

08:30 my own mental space yeah so I I am able
08:34 

08:34 to compartmentalize and know that it
08:36 

08:36 didn't happen to me it happened to her
08:40 

08:40 and I feel certain way about it and
08:42 

08:42 these are the options that are out there
08:46 

08:46 but it's actually not in my hands that
08:48 

08:48 much it's kind of that they have to act
08:51 

08:51 on it I already helped in the best way I
08:54 

08:54 can there are limits to my helping you
08:56 

08:56 know these this is their issue you have
08:58 

08:58 done your best you have give them the
09:01 

09:01 support they need basically whenever I
09:04 

09:04 have a problem that I cannot solve for
09:06 

09:06 this person I I'll tell them I'm just a
09:08 

09:08 text away or I'm just a call away so
09:11 

09:11 every time when they need me at least
09:13 

09:13 they know I'm there Assurance is like
09:16 

09:16 sometimes it's comforting enough to know
09:18 

09:18 that you have a person that's like a
09:20 

09:20 text or call way so if I know like let's
09:23 

09:23 say this person have a very personal
09:24 

09:24 problem like it's something that I
09:26 

09:26 cannot solve then I'll say but if you
09:28 

09:28 need someone to be like a little
09:29 

09:29 listening ear like I'm a text away I'm a
09:31 

09:31 call away and that is the solution at
09:33 

09:33 least from your perspective right cuz
09:36 

09:36 there's really nothing much you can do
09:38 

09:38 other than be the person's listening ear
09:41 

09:41 so that's why I didn't I won't take it
09:43 

09:43 so like oh wow I it's it's my fault it's
09:46 

09:46 all my fault I canot solve the problem
09:48 

09:48 but doesn't like just listening drain
09:50 

09:50 you it depends CU I wouldn't call myself
09:54 

09:54 highly empathetic I call myself highly
09:56 

09:56 sympathetic so it's like I can
09:58 

09:58 sympathize with the person but it won't
10:01 

10:01 affect my emotional state right wow yeah
10:05 

10:05 like this is more personality or
10:06 

10:06 something that you trained it's just I
10:08 

10:08 always Bor because mbti you said
10:12 

10:12 like I always born quite of a logical
10:15 

10:15 person so I always find myself like in
10:18 

10:18 terms of women female they're a bit more
10:22 

10:22 naturally in tune with other people's
10:24 

10:24 emotions right I'm not attuned to
10:27 

10:27 people's emotions like it's their
10:29 

10:29 business is their emotions they're
10:31 

10:31 responsible for their own emotions I'm
10:33 

10:33 responsible for my own emotions that's
10:35 

10:35 great but I know it can be trained like
10:38 

10:38 I know some of my more sensitive friends
10:40 

10:40 they learn a little bit from me cuz I
10:42 

10:42 guess I influence them a bit so they
10:43 

10:43 learn like okay I try not to take things
10:45 

10:45 personally yeah yeah I I I trained
10:48 

10:48 myself to compartmentalize like keep it
10:51 

10:51 a distance away but also be there for my
10:54 

10:54 friends uh but also know that it's not
10:57 

10:57 it's not my issue right right it's
10:60 

10:60 something that they would have to sort
11:02 

11:02 out themselves like later on and I I I
11:05 

11:05 love that like we have different
11:07 

11:07 strategies for different types of people
11:09 

11:09 that we put out um not for imposter
11:11 

11:11 syndrome but in this case like helping
11:13 

11:13 giving others a listening ear which you
11:16 

11:16 know happens even though we're in a tech
11:18 

11:18 industry and everything is technical but
11:20 

11:20 actually a
11:21 

11:21 lot it's people at the end of the day
11:24 

11:24 right our work is like 20% cold and then
11:27 

11:27 80% people stakeholder management
11:30 

11:30 and when it comes to lending people a
11:32 

11:32 listening ear part that kind of building
11:34 

11:34 Rapport there's also a bad side to it
11:37 

11:37 and how you manage that BS side also
11:38 

11:38 depends on identifying your own personal
11:41 

11:41 Pro proclivities almost like for you you
11:44 

11:44 mentioned you know your personality
11:46 

11:46 inside out you're you you've never been
11:48 

11:48 somebody who took uh uh somebody else's
11:50 

11:50 emotions and feelings and then
11:51 

11:51 superimposed it on yourself and then
11:53 

11:53 take it back home for you you said that
11:55 

11:55 you're kind of like in between um maybe
11:58 

11:58 more of you've learned the strategy of
11:60 

11:60 compartmentalizing and then for me I I I
12:02 

12:02 kind of knew that like okay I have that
12:04 

12:04 tendency so we all have different
12:06 

12:06 strategies to deal with that but the
12:08 

12:08 first step is in that selfawareness
12:10 

12:10 knowing how you're like unfortunately
12:13 

12:13 this knowing how you're like does have
12:15 

12:15 to come through a lot of lived
12:17 

12:17 experiences I had to learn it the hard
12:19 

12:19 way of getting incredibly burned out
12:21 

12:21 socially drained or to the extent of
12:23 

12:23 maybe somebody even taking advantage of
12:25 

12:25 that kind of vulnerability that you have
12:27 

12:27 to expose yourself to for somebody to
12:29 

12:29 give right I don't know if you talked
12:30 

12:30 about this in a previous episode or this
12:32 

12:32 episode but but basically giving
12:33 

12:33 yourself time to reflect uh on an
12:35 

12:35 everyday basis how did I feel today what
12:39 

12:39 happened today so you give yourself that
12:41 

12:41 hit space instead of like being forced
12:43 

12:43 through conflicting situations where
12:45 

12:45 you're like I have to learn the heart
12:46 

12:46 lesson now yeah I kind of try to train
12:49 

12:49 myself to be like I am my own listening
12:52 

12:52 ear talk to me talk to myself talk to
12:55 

12:55 myself actually I did read a book about
12:57 

12:57 it like you talking to yourself is good
12:60 

12:60 cuz it's like you're soundboarding
13:01 

13:01 yourself soundboarding yourself yeah
13:03 

13:03 like that's a good habit like I know
13:05 

13:05 people observing you will think you're
13:07 

13:07 crazy but it's a good thing yeah I I
13:10 

13:10 actually talk to myself like why do I
13:12 

13:12 feel that way or like S I even talk to
13:15 

13:15 myself as a what is affecting you why do
13:19 

13:19 you think it's like that you can take
13:21 

13:21 yourself out of the picture right see
13:23 

13:23 yourself as said third person
13:24 

13:24 perspective almost yeah yeah yeah but
13:28 

13:28 there are cases where you know Last
13:30 

13:30 Resort I'll will need someone else to
13:32 

13:32 look at everything that I've talked to
13:34 

13:34 myself already cuz we too weren't to
13:37 

13:37 resolve it slow me one
13:40 

13:40 slow to resolve it I need a third person
13:43 

13:43 you need a third person talk to us
13:46 

13:46 that's so funny true true that's
13:48 

13:48 definitely true and I agree with that
13:50 

13:50 yeah it's good that and we're not saying
13:52 

13:52 like there's a right or wrong strategy
13:53 

13:53 like all of us have our own different
13:55 

13:55 ways dependent on who you are what words
13:58 

13:58 on handling imposture syndrome helping
13:60 

13:60 others deal with imposture syndrome I
14:02 

14:02 think all of us have our own strength
14:04 

14:04 and we are able to capitalize on that
14:07 

14:07 and and I think son's got it really
14:09 

14:09 figured out which son want that is good
14:12 

14:12 no idea what's happening but
14:15 

14:15 yes yeah yeah yeah but for sure this
14:18 

14:18 this has been quite an interesting
14:19 

14:19 conversation as a whole I know like uh
14:22 

14:22 we started with impostor syndrome which
14:23 

14:23 will likely be the part one of this
14:25 

14:25 episode because we uh kind of went quite
14:28 

14:28 long here but it kind of segue into like
14:31 

14:31 just as a whole um your interactions
14:34 

14:34 with people at the workplace to
14:35 

14:35 acknowledge that those things U can have
14:38 

14:38 like an emotionally draining effect on
14:40 

14:40 you when other people have imp A
14:41 

14:41 syndrome you know they might come to you
14:43 

14:43 to problem solve or or like seek
14:46 

14:46 validation but it is also completely
14:48 

14:48 valid to feel like drein from that and
14:51 

14:51 feel like an emotional dumpster so how
14:53 

14:53 do you resolve that we've kind of put
14:54 

14:54 out different strategies the first part
14:56 

14:56 is to acknowledge the kind of inclin
14:59 

14:59 ations you have your personality be it
15:01 

15:01 through mbti and anagrams right that's
15:04 

15:04 something that you you recommended a lot
15:07 

15:07 uh or or be it through learning through
15:09 

15:09 experiences and how you feel through
15:11 

15:11 experiences and to expedite that process
15:13 

15:13 documenting day on day how you feel
15:16 

15:16 towards each interaction rather than
15:17 

15:17 letting it accumulate and only
15:19 

15:19 reflecting after a big event has
15:20 

15:20 happened knowing yourself that first and
15:23 

15:23 then two adopting the right strategies
15:24 

15:24 that's tailored to that sense of self
15:27 

15:27 and awareness that you've attained these
15:29 

15:29 strategies pertain to both dealing with
15:32 

15:32 imposter syndrome as well as I guess
15:33 

15:33 helping others deal with impostor
15:35 

15:35 syndrome and as a whole like interacting
15:37 

15:37 in a corporate environment yeah I I I
15:40
