00:00 hello and welcome to rec
00:03 

00:03 Tech uh where we would be doing bites
00:06 

00:06 and bent on everything Tech
00:12 

00:12 related so let's start with
00:15 

00:15 introductions yeah I'm Natasha I'm a
00:17 

00:17 software engineer I'm Salone also a
00:19 

00:19 software engineer and I'm Victoria
00:20 

00:20 Solutions engineer yes and today's
00:22 

00:22 episode we will be getting to know
00:25 

00:25 Natasha
00:26 

00:26 better so Natasha yeah yes uh Natasha so
00:31 

00:31 Natasha is allrounder in our group she
00:34 

00:34 is the one who like has her involvement
00:36 

00:36 in many different projects uh many
00:39 

00:39 different organizations that she herself
00:42 

00:42 organized uh so before we get get into
00:45 

00:45 like how you how you do time management
00:48 

00:48 can you let's tell us about a couple of
00:50 

00:50 things that you're actively working on
00:52 

00:52 at the moment wow okay um so primarily
00:56 

00:56 I'm a software engineer and that's still
00:57 

00:57 my favorite way of introducing myself
00:59 

00:59 because I have been doing um I guess
01:01 

01:01 software engineering coding since like
01:03 

01:03 you know back in school but the last um
01:07 

01:07 two years since after University
01:09 

01:09 basically uh I've basically been like a
01:11 

01:11 founding software engineer but
01:13 

01:13 specializing in zero to1 products really
01:15 

01:15 founding products from scratch and all
01:17 

01:17 these products that are software related
01:19 

01:19 um so kind of doing that but also doing
01:21 

01:21 like a mix of um technical product
01:23 

01:23 manage management I also had to dabble
01:26 

01:26 uh quite a little bit in uxui design as
01:28 

01:28 well because I think that thing with
01:29 

01:29 like Z to one products by Nature you're
01:32 

01:32 kind of forced to be very cross
01:34 

01:34 functional and you're kind of forced to
01:35 

01:35 be very lean as well so I I would start
01:38 

01:38 out in very small teams and then scale
01:39 

01:39 it after so kind of because of that
01:42 

01:42 nature of work um I would describe
01:45 

01:45 myself as a cross functional software
01:47 

01:47 engineer um but in terms of like the
01:50 

01:50 other things that I'm doing so that's my
01:51 

01:51 9 to5 in terms of my like 5 to9 I'm a
01:54 

01:54 woman of Court like you guys that's how
01:56 

01:56 we met um so um one of the evangelists
01:59 

01:59 there
02:00 

02:00 um I also like oh there's also this
02:03 

02:03 podcast like that's the other thing that
02:05 

02:05 we're doing together um but on the side
02:08 

02:08 um I have a nonprofit that just got
02:10 

02:10 registered it's called mro meow it's a
02:13 

02:13 nonprofit for critical care uh kittens
02:15 

02:15 that um basically I've been a foster uh
02:18 

02:18 uh fosterer for like Critical Care
02:20 

02:20 kittens which are basically like kittens
02:21 

02:21 are 8 weeks and Below without their moms
02:24 

02:24 so they require like specialized All
02:25 

02:25 Around the Clock care I've been doing
02:27 

02:27 that for 5 years and then when I came
02:28 

02:28 back to Singapore um realized it was
02:31 

02:31 like quite a gap in terms of training
02:33 

02:33 new Critical Care fosterers there's
02:34 

02:34 basically like about one to two if
02:36 

02:36 you're lucky in one shelter Alone um
02:38 

02:38 there's also a lack of like resources
02:41 

02:41 for like neoc Critical Care Fosters
02:43 

02:43 things like heating pads cuz like
02:44 

02:44 kittens um they can't like regulate
02:46 

02:46 their own temperature specialize nipples
02:48 

02:48 to like bottle feed them um and also
02:51 

02:51 lastly because you know coming from like
02:52 

02:52 a software engineer experience I realize
02:54 

02:54 a lot of the processes of R manual so
02:56 

02:56 there's a lack of like an endtoend um
02:58 

02:58 rescue to adoption system and just
03:02 

03:02 what's the best way to do this uh it was
03:03 

03:03 one of like the Vets at SPCA was it the
03:06 

03:06 best thing that you can do right now is
03:08 

03:08 to start your own like uh nonprofit um
03:12 

03:12 and then kind of like help aggregate all
03:14 

03:14 these things that you want to do so
03:16 

03:16 that's also another thing I'm doing at
03:17 

03:17 the side um other things it's it's like
03:21 

03:21 kind of like all over the place um I'm
03:24 

03:24 in a lot of like different communities
03:26 

03:26 because I I learn best by like talking
03:28 

03:28 to people so um definely being in a Tech
03:31 

03:31 Community through women and code has
03:32 

03:32 been like amazing like being able to
03:34 

03:34 connect across um all different
03:37 

03:37 communities across the different
03:38 

03:38 verticals like you know there's software
03:39 

03:39 engineering and then there's like devops
03:42 

03:42 and then there's like even robotics yeah
03:44 

03:44 that's been like really amazing um but
03:46 

03:46 I'm also trying to understand more about
03:48 

03:48 like the startup space right now because
03:50 

03:50 I used to uh kind of uh have my own
03:53 

03:53 startup like kind of it was a
03:55 

03:55 culmination of my research um back in
03:58 

03:58 like undergraduate where I had the
03:59 

03:59 amazing opportunity to work with the
04:01 

04:01 founder of the internet on U my thesis
04:04 

04:04 which was to create a um an algorithm a
04:07 

04:07 prediction algorithm for Innovation
04:09 

04:09 tragic trees using um us uh patents and
04:12 

04:12 trademarks uh data and then after that
04:16 

04:16 there was a conversation about like
04:17 

04:17 maybe we could commercialize um that
04:20 

04:20 technology and see where it goes and
04:22 

04:22 then when I was uh doing my masters in
04:25 

04:25 Boston um kind of like um en wrote
04:27 

04:27 myself in a few incubators both in like
04:30 

04:30 uh Boston University and MIT and that's
04:32 

04:32 where I kind of like learned that um a
04:36 

04:36 product and a startup is not just about
04:38 

04:38 like the development itself I think
04:40 

04:40 literally like the one thing they told
04:41 

04:41 me to do was like stop all development
04:43 

04:43 work you need to find product Market fit
04:45 

04:45 you need to talk to people find your
04:46 

04:46 user group first because if you start
04:48 

04:48 with the solution first rather than a
04:50 

04:50 problem nobody's going to buy your
04:51 

04:51 product so yeah so that's also kind of
04:54 

04:54 like why I kind of want to re-enter that
04:56 

04:56 startup space now that I'm back in
04:57 

04:57 Singapore and I've been like quite
04:59 

04:59 active in that Community as well so I
05:01 

05:01 guess that would be one of the sides
05:03 

05:03 that I'm doing um yeah I also have like
05:06 

05:06 this app thing like going on aside but
05:08 

05:08 maybe I'll share that a little bit later
05:10 

05:10 when it's at the MVP stage but yes I
05:13 

05:13 think that's a glossery okay yeah cuz
05:16 

05:16 there's a lot to debunk here Sor debunk
05:20 

05:20 I mean sorry there's a lot to break down
05:22 

05:22 here because actually I was going to ask
05:24 

05:24 you about like the startup that you
05:26 

05:26 co-founded back in University which you
05:28 

05:28 already touched upon um um so going back
05:31 

05:31 to that I know when we first met you
05:33 

05:33 were a panelist for Womanhood code and
05:36 

05:36 oh yeah that's true and you were talking
05:39 

05:39 about the startup that you did is like
05:43 

05:43 starting up like and building products
05:45 

05:45 from scratch is that something that
05:46 

05:46 you've always seen yourself wanting to
05:48 

05:48 do or is it something that you know it
05:50 

05:50 just came upon you yeah that's such an
05:52 

05:52 interesting question but yeah I think
05:54 

05:54 because the way I started out coding was
05:57 

05:57 building my own products which honestly
05:59 

05:59 like that's kind of how we all started
06:01 

06:01 basically um I was already working
06:02 

06:02 before I went to college uh and when I
06:05 

06:05 was working the in the training phase of
06:08 

06:08 um the work environment I was in I
06:10 

06:10 noticed a gap in terms of training
06:12 

06:12 resources and um when I asked around
06:15 

06:15 about like expanding on that specific
06:16 

06:16 training resource um they said uh that
06:20 

06:20 like they couldn't do so within the
06:21 

06:21 organization so I think coding became
06:24 

06:24 one of like the Avenues I started
06:26 

06:26 exploring when I Googled uh was a way to
06:28 

06:28 code up my own training resource on my
06:30 

06:30 own personal device so that's kind of
06:32 

06:32 like how I entered it so I shed out
06:34 

06:34 creating my own like software um and
06:36 

06:36 then when I went to um College uh I
06:39 

06:39 think like the experience I had in
06:41 

06:41 University like again you're it's more
06:43 

06:43 of a self-starter kind of nature um
06:45 

06:45 where you're kind of building your own
06:47 

06:47 projects for like cores um you're also
06:50 

06:50 like I was in a student run club called
06:52 

06:52 like Lion which uh was basically a
06:55 

06:55 coding club for uh where we teach coding
06:57 

06:57 to amateurs so usually people uh who are
06:59 

06:59 are not necessarily in like the computer
07:02 

07:02 science department um and through that
07:04 

07:04 again a lot of like things where um you
07:06 

07:06 do it yourself you create your products
07:08 

07:08 on your own so I don't think that the um
07:11 

07:11 notion of like building my own zero to
07:14 

07:14 one product was necessarily what got me
07:16 

07:16 into the space because I think everybody
07:18 

07:18 has had that experience but I realized I
07:20 

07:20 did enjoy the process of
07:22 

07:22 ideation um and uh I think when I
07:25 

07:25 started on my own research thesis like
07:28 

07:28 you know research is also about like
07:30 

07:30 having your own idea your own hypothesis
07:32 

07:32 and then going through the process of
07:34 

07:34 like um creating these thesis to prove
07:37 

07:37 that yeah I guess I don't know that's
07:40 

07:40 kind of like I how I got into like
07:43 

07:43 starting my own products um I'm not that
07:47 

07:47 that's really a good question for me to
07:49 

07:49 reflect on though cuz uh I've never yet
07:51 

07:51 been in a Sit situation that I've been
07:53 

07:53 thrown into a product that's already
07:55 

07:55 been built um I I guess for both of you
07:58 

07:58 you guys came into companies and
07:59 

07:59 organizations where the product is
08:01 

08:01 really well established but I think for
08:03 

08:03 me I've just been thrown into a lot of
08:05 

08:05 situations where things were not built
08:08 

08:08 out yet I I was always uh brought in to
08:10 

08:10 fill like a a niche or a gap so I think
08:13 

08:13 it's just by virtue of like that
08:15 

08:15 experience not so much of like um that's
08:19 

08:19 something I Define Myself by but I do
08:22 

08:22 see like uh that's why my skill sets
08:24 

08:24 have kind of developed in that um but at
08:26 

08:26 the same time I think that's why my I
08:29 

08:29 still feel like I have a lot to learn um
08:32 

08:32 I know what it takes to build like a
08:33 

08:33 product from zero to one but I don't
08:35 

08:35 really know yet what it means to what in
08:38 

08:38 like an Enterprise setting with a skill
08:40 

08:40 product which you know you both have um
08:43 

08:43 so yeah in terms of trajectory of moving
08:44 

08:44 forward I do want to see through a
08:46 

08:46 product in that stage but I don't know
08:49 

08:49 how that's going to turn out but yeah
08:51 

08:51 just is there any products right now
08:53 

08:53 that you're currently building that's
08:55 

08:55 you know going to that phase soon or
08:58 

08:58 yeah no that's the thing cuz it's like I
09:02 

09:02 always see through products until like
09:03 

09:03 the one to two year mark and then by the
09:06 

09:06 time like uh just in my organization
09:09 

09:09 especially by the time I reach that Mark
09:11 

09:11 I'm rotated to another role because they
09:14 

09:14 have another need to start another
09:15 

09:15 product or S another like um uh outfit
09:18 

09:18 that requires software engineering um
09:21 

09:21 again it's by virtue of like the
09:23 

09:23 organizations I'm in um so no I haven't
09:26 

09:26 actually had that experience but I I
09:28 

09:28 don't know if would necessarily like
09:30 

09:30 enjoy it but I think if I don't try and
09:32 

09:32 explore it yeah then I wouldn't know but
09:35 

09:35 at this stage yeah no like from someone
09:38 

09:38 who has seen a product uh Gone live and
09:42 

09:42 like the we call it the maintenance bit
09:44 

09:44 of it cuz then it's just maintaining it
09:46 

09:46 yeah uh I personally do not like to be
09:49 

09:49 in that face that phase of a project so
09:53 

09:53 I want to be rotated out at that point
09:56 

09:56 so that's why it was like oh people
09:58 

09:58 actually want to go to that I mean for
09:60 

09:60 your learning purpose yes but M usually
10:03 

10:03 people do not want to unless like like I
10:05 

10:05 know some people who want to stay in
10:06 

10:06 that maintenance space because it's more
10:10 

10:10 comfortable cuz you know what issues
10:12 

10:12 will be coming in it's very routine yeah
10:15 

10:15 but for me and uh quite like people like
10:18 

10:18 me we would be more interested in Green
10:20 

10:20 Field projects so starting out a new
10:23 

10:23 thing so we always looking for green
10:25 

10:25 field or like to rotate out to somewhere
10:27 

10:27 else every few years yeah I don't think
10:30 

10:30 you're missing out on too much if you
10:32 

10:32 but it's good that you have seen at
10:34 

10:34 least two to 3 years of building out and
10:37 

10:37 like you know adding on features to it I
10:38 

10:38 think that's good enough yeah yeah of
10:41 

10:41 course uh scalability wise like how many
10:43 

10:43 people are using it that's that's
10:45 

10:45 something different that you show
10:47 

10:47 experience exactly I think that kind of
10:49 

10:49 scale I mean there was one project that
10:51 

10:51 actually went to that scale pretty
10:53 

10:53 rapidly um yeah without actually going
10:55 

10:55 into details of their project like that
10:57 

10:57 was an interesting experience cuz I had
10:58 

10:58 to like Implement so many many cous
10:60 

10:60 functions and the architecture of it was
11:02 

11:02 just insane uh that was a really good
11:05 

11:05 experience but it was very shortlived
11:07 

11:07 because it was sort of like a rapid
11:08 

11:08 response thing yeah but I think like
11:11 

11:11 thank you for validating that did I miss
11:13 

11:13 out too much I think you know um this
11:15 

11:15 you asked me this question before like I
11:17 

11:17 think what the first few times you met
11:19 

11:19 me were like not to offend you but you
11:21 

11:21 have you don't necessarily have a lot of
11:23 

11:23 years of experience but you talk like
11:25 

11:25 you've been through a lot and you know
11:28 

11:28 like certain things
11:30 

11:30 cuz uh the way you do explain things and
11:33 

11:33 the way you were even like just now when
11:34 

11:34 you were saying you could you can fill
11:36 

11:36 in gaps in certain startups how do you
11:39 

11:39 know how to fill in that Gap how do you
11:40 

11:40 know what a product manager does or like
11:43 

11:43 how a product even like what do senior
11:46 

11:46 software developers do you know cuz they
11:48 

11:48 have always been in startups
11:51 

11:51 sure so yeah I think it's just that like
11:55 

11:55 again going back to because I started
11:58 

11:58 all those products with my own own ideas
11:59 

11:59 and I have my own kind of like personal
12:02 

12:02 stake in it and I really wanted to
12:04 

12:04 succeed and um I I was just forced to be
12:07 

12:07 very cost functional um I definitely
12:10 

12:10 like learn a lot through like the people
12:11 

12:11 I work with um you know when I am in the
12:14 

12:14 design phase the early uh user Discovery
12:17 

12:17 phase like um I would have to learn from
12:20 

12:20 other uxui uh researchers and designers
12:22 

12:22 like what do you do on a day on day and
12:24 

12:24 I forced myself to not just like learn
12:26 

12:26 it but to really take down notes and
12:28 

12:28 implement it straight away so that's
12:30 

12:30 kind of like in that starting phase of
12:31 

12:31 the project the first three months is
12:33 

12:33 usually like just pure user Discovery
12:35 

12:35 yeah I really rapidly learn I I uh put
12:37 

12:37 myself to the task of like learning
12:39 

12:39 figma going through the difficult
12:40 

12:40 process of doing up my own uh uh mockups
12:43 

12:43 um and then like right after that then
12:45 

12:45 becomes the development phase again I'm
12:47 

12:47 not going at it alone I make sure I'm
12:49 

12:49 asking other people who are doing it
12:51 

12:51 already like what does it take to kind
12:54 

12:54 of like decide on a starting text de how
12:56 

12:56 does it affect the scalability of the
12:58 

12:58 product on the road uh especially when
12:60 

12:60 it comes to decisions to kind of change
13:01 

13:01 out your sack um so I think at every
13:04 

13:04 phase of like starting up a product it
13:08 

13:08 it's it's really like a really rapid way
13:11 

13:11 of looking at different business
13:12 

13:12 functions of a larger company you know I
13:15 

13:15 I'm just kind of forced to go through
13:16 

13:16 all those verticals all on my own
13:18 

13:18 because it's so lean um kind of forced
13:20 

13:20 to learn like uh devops like a very
13:23 

13:23 early stage because it's just like I
13:24 

13:24 have no devops engineer at that point to
13:27 

13:27 kind of fall back on so again like okay
13:29 

13:29 who do I ask who do I learn from and
13:32 

13:32 then right after asking implementing it
13:34 

13:34 yeah when it came to like actually
13:36 

13:36 having to uh design like the solution
13:38 

13:38 architecture I don't know anything about
13:39 

13:39 solution architecture when I first
13:41 

13:41 started out but who's the best person to
13:42 

13:42 ask ask uh watch him Implement learn you
13:45 

13:45 know kind of like the rapid extreme pair
13:48 

13:48 programming just because it's survival
13:51 

13:51 mode at that point um I think that's a
13:53 

13:53 lot of like the startup mentality I mean
13:56 

13:56 it's great that in a lot of this these
13:58 

13:58 scenarios I was within the large larger
14:01 

14:01 umbrella of an organization so it's not
14:04 

14:04 like I'm running out of money and then
14:05 

14:05 try and I I don't know I have no money
14:07 

14:07 to survive and being broke um but at the
14:10 

14:10 same time it's also because I'm starting
14:12 

14:12 up something so new uh and the other
14:14 

14:14 organizational business functions can
14:16 

14:16 technically survive without my product I
14:18 

14:18 have a lot more to prove so that's where
14:20 

14:20 the survival mindset really comes in and
14:23 

14:23 forces me to kind of learn and Implement
14:25 

14:25 these things at scill and at at speed um
14:29 

14:29 um so yeah I think like those things if
14:32 

14:32 I don't think about scalability at the
14:34 

14:34 start State and I were to like let this
14:35 

14:35 product just go on and I get removed
14:37 

14:37 from the product um because in the large
14:40 

14:40 organization they can rotate you then
14:43 

14:43 you know H how is the product going to
14:44 

14:44 survive Beyond me so I am forced to
14:46 

14:46 think about scalability at the start I
14:48 

14:48 am forced to apply like um uh software
14:51 

14:51 engineering best practices at the start
14:52 

14:52 but where do I learn this from I really
14:54 

14:54 back borrow steal and I talk to
14:55 

14:55 everybody I know and I think that's why
14:57 

14:57 I am so out out there in the community
15:00 

15:00 also it's because this is again like the
15:02 

15:02 best way for me to learn like whatever
15:04 

15:04 interactions I have with whatever person
15:06 

15:06 I make sure that I implement it right
15:08 

15:08 after uh as fast as possible so I don't
15:11 

15:11 like lose that knowledge so yeah what
15:14 

15:14 what what like what I'm getting out of
15:15 

15:15 this is that you're not afraid to ask
15:17 

15:17 questions firstly like you and you don't
15:20 

15:20 you're not afraid to uh I mean you have
15:23 

15:23 a good Network so you use your network
15:25 

15:25 well as well for example we did the
15:29 

15:29 audio setting for this with your friend
15:31 

15:31 John and you very quickly learned the
15:33 

15:33 tools and the tricks to implement it
15:36 

15:36 this time around and then we have Adam
15:38 

15:38 in the background in behind the scenes
15:41 

15:41 also a friend of Natasha's Natasha and I
15:44 

15:44 mean we as well we quickly very quickly
15:46 

15:46 learn like okay so these are the good
15:49 

15:49 angles right so it's it's very
15:51 

15:51 intentional and you're not afraid to
15:53 

15:53 give back either so if someone ever asks
15:55 

15:55 you for help you're always there for
15:57 

15:57 them it's really about giving back but I
15:59 

15:59 think I really like your point of like
16:01 

16:01 I'm just not afraid to ask I think um
16:05 

16:05 that is a quality that I feel has given
16:08 

16:08 me a lot of Leverage um I mean I
16:10 

16:10 definitely didn't start out with that um
16:13 

16:13 I think growing up in you know
16:15 

16:15 Singapore's education system um I was
16:17 

16:17 taught a lot about like um don't ask
16:20 

16:20 stupid questions as much as possible
16:21 

16:21 because you don't want to look stupid
16:23 

16:23 but I realized how much that was holding
16:25 

16:25 me back especially when I went overseas
16:27 

16:27 for my education um to the states that
16:30 

16:30 if I don't ask I really would not know
16:32 

16:32 because I am in the sea of like other
16:35 

16:35 university um like students who um yeah
16:39 

16:39 basically are so much more talented than
16:41 

16:41 I am I'm also thrown into like these big
16:43 

16:43 university lecture Halls like if I don't
16:45 

16:45 ask I really won't know I will fail the
16:47 

16:47 class um so yeah I think being thrown in
16:50 

16:50 those scenarios and learning and looking
16:53 

16:53 at like my um fellow classmates actively
16:56 

16:56 asking these questions the whole nature
16:58 

16:58 of there's no stupid question um was
16:60 

16:60 something that I really adopted and when
17:02 

17:02 I came back I definitely um really
17:05 

17:05 exercised that so the first one just ask
17:08 

17:08 if you don't know and also the ability
17:10 

17:10 to acknowledge when you don't know yeah
17:12 

17:12 I think that's also something that um
17:15 

17:15 has uh helped me a lot um when somebody
17:18 

17:18 says something I don't know I
17:19 

17:19 immediately ask like what is that yeah
17:21 

17:21 it's and you know there there is no
17:23 

17:23 shame in asking that in fact I learned
17:25 

17:25 that a lot of people want to share you
17:27 

17:27 know there's always that fear of like
17:29 

17:29 what if this person thinks I'm stupid
17:31 

17:31 but really that person uh more than
17:33 

17:33 anything is impressed that you're asking
17:35 

17:35 the question and really want to share
17:37 

17:37 about that subject but you know base he
17:40 

17:40 he's also extra he or she is
17:41 

17:41 extrapolating from his own experience
17:43 

17:43 and he knows his subject so he might not
17:45 

17:45 have thought that you might not know so
17:48 

17:48 how else is he going to explain that if
17:50 

17:50 you don't ask yeah sorry my voice oh
17:54 

17:54 know where you going guy crack voice
17:55 

17:55 crack um so actually adding on to that I
17:59 

17:59 also like Jordan Peterson's mindset of
18:01 

18:01 like if you ask stupid questions you
18:03 

18:03 only be stupid once so technically you
18:05 

18:05 will only ask one stupid question once
18:07 

18:07 but after that you learn so it's better
18:10 

18:10 to be stupid just once than continuously
18:12 

18:12 be stupid and never gain that knowledge
18:15 

18:15 so that's what he mentioned before and I
18:16 

18:16 really just like that mindset you know
18:18 

18:18 like it's okay to look stupid right
18:20 

18:20 because everyone does have like things
18:22 

18:22 that they don't know about and yeah um I
18:25 

18:25 also like what you said about you know
18:27 

18:27 how you you should just ask right and
18:29 

18:29 people will actually help you so even
18:31 

18:31 when we're like starting rag tag you
18:33 

18:33 know we're we're like asking a lot of
18:35 

18:35 people for help but we don't know how to
18:37 

18:37 set up we don't know how to do this like
18:39 

18:39 which platforms and all that and people
18:41 

18:41 just kindly like really take their time
18:43 

18:43 to like help us so I just find that
18:46 

18:46 really something that I learned
18:47 

18:47 definitely through you that it's okay to
18:50 

18:50 ask for help that's something that I
18:52 

18:52 personally just struggle with I guess
18:54 

18:54 cuz we tech industry growing up in Asia
18:57 

18:57 like there's just that culture like
18:59 

18:59 don't ask stupid questions but you know
19:03 

19:03 after being a part of a community and
19:05 

19:05 seeing how you know you learn so fast by
19:07 

19:07 asking questions it's like so much
19:10 

19:10 easier right to just seek for help like
19:13 

19:13 it's always good to seek help from
19:15 

19:15 someone who's wiser and like knows more
19:17 

19:17 about this topic than you exactly yeah
19:20 

19:20 and I think a big part of it is also
19:22 

19:22 making sure that the community around me
19:23 

19:23 adopts the same culture so I think
19:26 

19:26 suddenly I try to build those
19:28 

19:28 environments in every single org
19:30 

19:30 organization that I'm in I am always the
19:32 

19:32 first person to kind of like admit when
19:35 

19:35 I really don't know anything and that I
19:37 

19:37 need help like like say where um I don't
19:40 

19:40 know like women who code um when I
19:43 

19:43 didn't know anything about um what event
19:47 

19:47 uh what the event management process was
19:49 

19:49 you know what social media like
19:51 

19:51 management looked like like immediately
19:52 

19:52 I was like oh no I need help can
19:54 

19:54 somebody help me and I make sure to make
19:55 

19:55 that as public as possible like it's not
19:57 

19:57 just like oneon-one where I asked
19:59 

19:59 Victoria more experienced evangelist
20:00 

20:00 like how do I do this I make sure to ask
20:03 

20:03 in like the wider group and this is
20:05 

20:05 something that I practice for um the
20:07 

20:07 other uh software engineering teams or
20:09 

20:09 product teams that I'm in you know I
20:11 

20:11 make sure to publicly acknowledge that I
20:14 

20:14 don't know something because you see
20:16 

20:16 once you do it once or twice other
20:18 

20:18 people start following suit and they
20:20 

20:20 start realizing that you know this
20:21 

20:21 person like did that I can do that too
20:23 

20:23 on a public uh platform no less um so I
20:27 

20:27 think a lot about it and um that is
20:29 

20:29 something that I learned um in through
20:32 

20:32 through being in Tech actually uh not so
20:34 

20:34 much of like being in the US um I was
20:37 

20:37 very lucky that in the the first product
20:39 

20:39 that I did I was working with um a
20:42 

20:42 really wonderful uh Mentor uh who also
20:45 

20:45 did programming with me who also taught
20:47 

20:47 me everything I knew about like uh what
20:50 

20:50 it takes to work in a software
20:51 

20:51 engineering team he was basically the
20:53 

20:53 senior engineering uh engineer I was
20:55 

20:55 learning from and also like he's a CTO
20:57 

20:57 of his company for like 12 years right
20:60 

20:60 um but I was very humbl by how you know
21:03 

21:03 true through even like a peer review
21:05 

21:05 process um when I implemented like uh
21:08 

21:08 something different his first question
21:11 

21:11 would be like why did you do it this way
21:13 

21:13 obviously like coming from um somebody
21:14 

21:14 who was scared of rejection I took it as
21:16 

21:16 like oh no he's actually questioning
21:18 

21:18 like he's more experienced I must be
21:20 

21:20 wrong but you know when I um took the
21:23 

21:23 courage to answer it of oh I I thought
21:24 

21:24 it was like this I was reading this
21:26 

21:26 resource I thought this was a better uh
21:28 

21:28 option but you know if I'm wrong like
21:30 

21:30 please tell me he actually replied like
21:32 

21:32 oh I didn't know that actually yeah good
21:36 

21:36 implementation yeah so he started out
21:38 

21:38 with that that was like my first few
21:39 

21:39 weeks of working with him and he taught
21:42 

21:42 uh me the culture of like actively
21:45 

21:45 reviewing and criticizing um each
21:48 

21:48 other's work regardless of what like
21:50 

21:50 experience level you are so we had this
21:53 

21:53 really amazing process of being peer
21:56 

21:56 reviewed by him and then we whoop peer
21:58 

21:58 review our literal peer on the same
22:00 

22:00 level and he would review our reviews W
22:04 

22:04 to make sure that we um were giving
22:07 

22:07 actual like criticis he made sure we did
22:09 

22:09 line by line reviews and even as a
22:11 

22:11 12year CTO he was still doing line by
22:14 

22:14 line reviews it it was actually amazing
22:17 

22:17 so I feel I learned a lot about this
22:19 

22:19 culture through him you know I actively
22:22 

22:22 asked when I didn't know anything
22:23 

22:23 because he would actively ask he was
22:25 

22:25 just like um wait what version number is
22:27 

22:27 this I actually why didn't we migrate oh
22:29 

22:29 I didn't know about this and he would
22:31 

22:31 always like talk about that in a public
22:33 

22:33 group um I think the tendency to kind of
22:35 

22:35 PM someone and just be like hey actually
22:38 

22:38 why did you make uh this is can you
22:39 

22:39 teach me it's it's it's like High um but
22:42 

22:42 he also did that in like very public
22:43 

22:43 Avenues be it through our shared code
22:45 

22:45 repository or like our shared um like
22:49 

22:49 chat so yeah I think he's proliferated
22:52 

22:52 that in his company and in my team but I
22:55 

22:55 took that um also like Beyond just like
22:57 

22:57 coding as well but also in the wider
22:59 

22:59 industry and all the other things I'm
23:01 

23:01 doing yeah that's a very nice
23:05 

23:05 perspective yeah yeah yeah I really like
23:08 

23:08 how you mention like him as like someone
23:10 

23:10 that you know you look up to and you
23:12 

23:12 actually kind of like you know taking
23:14 

23:14 what he did and like kind of like spread
23:16 

23:16 that around like definitely your energy
23:18 

23:18 is so contagious like I remember first
23:21 

23:21 meeting you and then like you're part of
23:23 

23:23 Womanhood code like you're a panelist
23:25 

23:25 and all that like you really just know
23:27 

23:27 how to com Comm unicate well to people
23:29 

23:29 and just bring things to life like
23:31 

23:31 exactly and so this is like my personal
23:35 

23:35 out of curiosity for you is like since
23:37 

23:37 you have been founding teams you know
23:39 

23:39 for a while now like what is one thing
23:41 

23:41 that you are particularly like try to um
23:45 

23:45 make sure that you know how how do you
23:47 

23:47 make sure things run smoothly like in
23:49 

23:49 terms of like you know communication
23:51 

23:51 culture wise or like even like making
23:54 

23:54 sure the team works as a team because I
23:56 

23:56 know there's like definitely team
23:58 

23:58 culture that are like more
23:59 

23:59 individualistic a bit like you know less
24:02 

24:02 like collaborative so how do you like
24:04 

24:04 ensure there's that culture right right
24:08 

24:08 yeah I think I can come through in this
24:10 

24:10 in a um there's a technical perspective
24:13 

24:13 and the S more cultural perspective but
24:16 

24:16 in terms of like um the technical
24:17 

24:17 perspective is that every time I come um
24:20 

24:20 I carry on a mindset of like I need to
24:22 

24:22 make myself dispensable like definitely
24:24 

24:24 not now but just like that should be the
24:26 

24:26 end goal uh and I should expect that The
24:28 

24:28 Upfront investment of the effort will be
24:30 

24:30 all on me first so to put in my 200%
24:33 

24:33 when something starts uh and that 200%
24:36 

24:36 of that effort should be in creating
24:38 

24:38 structures and processes um but before
24:40 

24:40 creating those structures and processes
24:42 

24:42 it's also about understanding the
24:44 

24:44 existing one um you know identifying the
24:48 

24:48 current gaps uh and being very active in
24:50 

24:50 like talking to different people to
24:52 

24:52 understand what they do um to kind of
24:54 

24:54 discover that and then trying to see how
24:56 

24:56 everything pieces together in terms of
24:58 

24:58 of a structuring process that would
24:59 

24:59 benefit everybody as a whole and at no
25:01 

25:01 single point am I trying to make myself
25:03 

25:03 like the key Cornerstone I need to see
25:06 

25:06 um how a structure and process could
25:09 

25:09 like survive even when I leave um
25:12 

25:12 because you know um I I've seen this too
25:14 

25:14 much in like large um bureaucratic
25:16 

25:16 organizations that when somebody leaves
25:18 

25:18 a whole project just falls apart and I
25:20 

25:20 think that's really you know unfair but
25:22 

25:22 I also kind of like understand that
25:24 

25:24 certain HR systems do incentivize that
25:27 

25:27 you know like by making yourself
25:29 

25:29 indispensable you know um your bosses
25:31 

25:31 talk more highly of you because it's
25:33 

25:33 just like he's an indispensable member
25:35 

25:35 of the team but if somebody makes that
25:36 

25:36 comment I think that's not a compliment
25:40 

25:40 like this person has um maybe not by
25:43 

25:43 like any malicious nature but he's never
25:46 

25:46 thought about like how this can skill
25:48 

25:48 Beyond him Beyond himself and his team
25:51 

25:51 um also by he I don't I mean like he or
25:53 

25:53 she like they oh my gosh don't cancel
25:56 

25:56 me but um yeah so that's definitely the
25:59 

25:59 more technical part of things to really
26:01 

26:01 think about everything as a structure
26:03 

26:03 and a process like problems don't happen
26:05 

26:05 by chance problems don't happen by
26:08 

26:08 people but they happen um because of an
26:11 

26:11 overall systemic issue yeah because we
26:14 

26:14 live in a society but like yeah
26:15 

26:15 basically
26:16 

26:16 that the other part is the cultural part
26:20 

26:20 again like system structures and
26:22 

26:22 processes aren't anything if like the
26:24 

26:24 people aren't in it um I put a lot of
26:27 

26:27 emphasis on knowing people's people as
26:31 

26:31 like what their inclinations and
26:33 

26:33 motivations are as a person you don't
26:35 

26:35 come into like an organization and your
26:36 

26:36 pure goal is just to make money it's
26:38 

26:38 just to like be more famous and
26:40 

26:40 recognize you know um we all have
26:42 

26:42 intrinsic goals that allow us to be
26:45 

26:45 driven in everything that we do and if I
26:48 

26:48 can align your goals with the larger
26:50 

26:50 organizational uh goal by some way or
26:52 

26:52 another you know with a wholehearted way
26:55 

26:55 of trying to genuinely benefit your
26:57 

26:57 dream Journey which I know will benefit
26:59 

26:59 mine because I'm learning through you
27:00 

27:00 right um I think that's the best
27:02 

27:02 approach I take I make sure that every
27:05 

27:05 interaction I have um with people is
27:08 

27:08 genuine and authentic and I want to
27:10 

27:10 connect with them as a person not as
27:12 

27:12 like a LinkedIn connection you know I
27:14 

27:14 think that's something very important to
27:15 

27:15 me um and there is no um experience
27:19 

27:19 level that is too high or experience
27:21 

27:21 level that is too low everybody is just
27:23 

27:23 like a person to me you know um and I
27:28 

27:28 everybody has like value to that
27:30 

27:30 particular organization I mean have
27:32 

27:32 value to me in terms of learning so um
27:35 

27:35 that's also something that I hold true
27:37 

27:37 to and I hope like people in that team
27:40 

27:40 kind of carry on their culture that they
27:43 

27:43 see um the people around them as well
27:48 

27:48 people not in the system so I
27:51 

27:51 think yeah maybe these two perspectives
27:52 

27:52 are what like kind of like helps drive
27:55 

27:55 my passion that's super inspiring and I
27:57 

27:57 think we can all see it like you doing
27:60 

27:60 all this that you mentioned like
28:02 

28:02 literally for woman who Cod yeah when
28:05 

28:05 you joined like things just started
28:08 

28:08 moving yeah a lot more people started
28:11 

28:11 voicing as well probably because yeah
28:14 

28:14 participating because you wrote things
28:16 

28:16 on the public for so then they were like
28:17 

28:17 oh if she can write it I can also write
28:19 

28:19 oh I'm also looking for something to
28:21 

28:21 volunteer on like oh yeah even I don't
28:23 

28:23 understand this kind of things then that
28:25 

28:25 makes it so much more better to like act
28:27 

28:27 on things make things move ahead yeah
28:30 

28:30 yeah and I think I've said this before
28:31 

28:31 and I'm also grateful to find people who
28:33 

28:33 share the same mindset and you know like
28:35 

28:35 in women of C because I'm so new and you
28:37 

28:37 know my strategy to doing things is
28:39 

28:39 there there is no room for hesitation um
28:41 

28:41 you have to leverage and I make mistakes
28:44 

28:44 as I go that's my process but the best
28:46 

28:46 way that I learn is when people point
28:48 

28:48 out those mistakes um and I appreciate
28:51 

28:51 you a lot for doing that uh you know
28:53 

28:53 you're the director of women of code
28:55 

28:55 which is so impressive and I I was was
28:58 

28:58 honestly a little bit afraid to kind of
28:60 

28:60 like reach out and interact with you uh
29:01 

29:01 Victoria at the very early stages was
29:03 

29:03 like yeah you should like propose this
29:05 

29:05 it's aloney you should do that and I
29:06 

29:06 hadn't interacted with you um and I was
29:09 

29:09 just kind of afraid but when um I
29:11 

29:11 started uh talking to you I realized how
29:13 

29:13 humble and down to earth you were and
29:15 

29:15 especially at work you're so objective
29:17 

29:17 too like you would literally say like oh
29:20 

29:20 uh you posted this this is great but at
29:22 

29:22 the same time like this part is actually
29:24 

29:24 against like our community guidelines
29:26 

29:26 and stuff like that and I'll just be
29:28 

29:28 like yeah I'll take it down like
29:29 

29:29 immediately like and I take it down and
29:31 

29:31 that that's just it and you're just like
29:33 

29:33 thanks move ahead to the next thing uh
29:35 

29:35 next thing okay yeah maybe this you
29:37 

29:37 could I appreciate that so much because
29:39 

29:39 it allows me to immediately learn and
29:41 

29:41 correct and there isn't any sense of
29:44 

29:44 like hesitation where are you personally
29:46 

29:46 attacking me are you going to like bear
29:47 

29:47 grudges against me and not allow me to
29:49 

29:49 like move things forward yeah so I think
29:53 

29:53 it's it's definitely that all came with
29:55 

29:55 experience as well like I I made try
29:57 

29:57 reason why I said certain things and
29:60 

29:60 also uh also appreciate you as well cuz
30:03 

30:03 not everyone would have taken it the way
30:05 

30:05 you did like you knew where I was coming
30:07 

30:07 from as well I think that wasn't the
30:09 

30:09 only point we had an interaction we also
30:12 

30:12 uh interacted a lot of different how to
30:14 

30:14 like manage the whole team and stuff
30:16 

30:16 like I was I had the freedom to like
30:19 

30:19 just say my whatever I thought do you I
30:22 

30:22 I didn't actually filter things or I
30:24 

30:24 think about it too much I you are
30:26 

30:26 someone who can can receive and and that
30:30 

30:30 you know where I'm coming from and you
30:31 

30:31 wouldn't get offended so easily like I
30:33 

30:33 could tell I could tell that's how she
30:35 

30:35 is so that made it even more comfortable
30:38 

30:38 so then I even like I was like okay you
30:41 

30:41 know what you have a great idea let's
30:43 

30:43 execute it actually let's try it out cuz
30:45 

30:45 I have never done it no one else would
30:47 

30:47 have ever done it so if you you seem to
30:50 

30:50 know things let's try it up and I took
30:52 

30:52 to make mistakes yeah that's why I think
30:55 

30:55 giving feedback and receiving feedbacks
30:57 

30:57 is like a the two-way street right like
30:59 

30:59 in order to give feedback you need to
31:01 

31:01 make sure you give it in a way that's
31:02 

31:02 not like personally it's like your
31:05 

31:05 feedbacking in terms of the action or or
31:08 

31:08 the things the result the outcome or
31:11 

31:11 something not the person individually
31:14 

31:14 yeah know I think this part is really
31:15 

31:15 important to me too like in terms of
31:17 

31:17 like when I give feedback it has to be
31:19 

31:19 something that the person can work on
31:21 

31:21 it's not something that the person can't
31:23 

31:23 change like a personal characteristic
31:26 

31:26 like if I tell a person like I don't
31:27 

31:27 know you're too honest like in your
31:29 

31:29 nature you're too honest you need to
31:30 

31:30 tone it down I've gotten that feedback
31:33 

31:33 myself but my feedback to that is just
31:35 

31:35 like then what do you want me to work on
31:37 

31:37 it should be something practical that uh
31:39 

31:39 would be like okay um I understand you
31:41 

31:41 have a very honest nature um but perhaps
31:44 

31:44 like in this context it might not have
31:45 

31:45 been appropriate to ask that question um
31:48 

31:48 maybe you could like perhaps direct that
31:50 

31:50 question to somebody else instead first
31:52 

31:52 you know stuff that I can immediately
31:54 

31:54 work on but you going to give me
31:55 

31:55 something that's like you know it's
31:57 

31:57 going to drive me into an existential
31:58 

31:58 crisis like I don't know what to do with
32:01 

32:01 that information so you're right like
32:03 

32:03 feedback is so important and the way you
32:04 

32:04 give feedback is also really important
32:06 

32:06 as well and at the end of the day that
32:08 

32:08 feedback should come from the heart that
32:10 

32:10 you're not trying to like actually hurt
32:12 

32:12 the person you really want the person to
32:14 

32:14 improve on behalf of that system or that
32:17 

32:17 organization you're both aligned with
32:20 

32:20 definitely definitely that's what I also
32:22 

32:22 try to be very mindful of cuz whenever
32:25 

32:25 my readers ask for feedback for like
32:27 

32:27 their articles I make sure to only talk
32:29 

32:29 about things within that article I will
32:31 

32:31 not talk about their writing skills I
32:33 

32:33 will not talk about oh may your sentence
32:36 

32:36 structure I don't like it like that's
32:38 

32:38 personal right yeah that's personal I
32:39 

32:39 will never tell them that way it's
32:41 

32:41 always objective like I'll say like you
32:43 

32:43 can use headers to structure your better
32:46 

32:46 objective actionable also like I feel
32:48 

32:48 like giving feedbacks a lot of it is
32:50 

32:50 actually
32:51 

32:51 opinion um even for example like you can
32:55 

32:55 you know add some haers or like like for
32:58 

32:58 example uh you shouldn't have asked this
32:60 

32:60 kind of question in such a scenario it's
33:02 

33:02 actually my opinion who's there to say
33:04 

33:04 that you should ask usually there's like
33:06 

33:06 a reason to back up like the reason why
33:08 

33:08 I say to you say yeah correct you say
33:11 

33:11 that and then you give your your
33:13 

33:13 reasoning but still it's an opinion yeah
33:16 

33:16 it's best practice I mean ter of unless
33:19 

33:19 it's de yes yeah yeah I mean it's also
33:21 

33:21 like how adding that like oh this is my
33:23 

33:23 personal opinion by the way and that you
33:25 

33:25 know perhaps like send articles
33:27 

33:27 resources to back that up you know you
33:29 

33:29 can read more or usually I like to add
33:31 

33:31 that like you know you should definitely
33:32 

33:32 ask more people though to get like a
33:34 

33:34 more like um like just opinion so I try
33:37 

33:37 to like copy at that we can really talk
33:39 

33:39 about a whole episode about like how Feb
33:42 

33:42 give feedback no no that's actually a
33:43 

33:43 really good idea yeah yeah cuz that's
33:45 

33:45 really important for self-improvement
33:47 

33:47 and I think a lot of software Engineers
33:48 

33:48 or even people outside of tech they're
33:50 

33:50 always looking for ways to improve but
33:53 

33:53 like it's difficult to really ask for
33:55 

33:55 feedback or even like when you're in the
33:57 

33:57 position of giving feedback how do you
33:58 

33:58 give like a constructive feedback I
34:00 

34:00 think that's something that yeah we
34:02 

34:02 should I have one last question for
34:04 

34:04 you good uh how do you manage your time
34:09 

34:09 schedule yeah a lot of times when we are
34:12 

34:12 talking to Natasha she has like I'm
34:14 

34:14 meeting this VC founder I'm meeting this
34:17 

34:17 startup meetup group or like you know
34:19 

34:19 I'm going for this other event and I'm
34:20 

34:20 going to this and I'm going to meet this
34:22 

34:22 person and and they're all good
34:24 

34:24 productive things but how do you manage
34:27 

34:27 day to cuz she managed to you have like
34:30 

34:30 a Google Calendar I do have a Google
34:32 

34:32 Calendar it is very colorful and the
34:34 

34:34 funniest thing is like before I start
34:36 

34:36 out a new week like it's usually empty
34:39 

34:39 and then by the start of the week it
34:41 

34:41 starts filling up so honestly I approach
34:43 

34:43 it from like I can't kind of like
34:46 

34:46 determine what's going to happen in like
34:49 

34:49 the week you know I I tend to be very
34:51 

34:51 present and that's something that I've
34:52 

34:52 learned because I used to be such a
34:55 

34:55 long-term planner like I I have had an
34:57 

34:57 Excel sheet like plotting for the rest
34:59 

34:59 of the 30 years of my life what career
35:02 

35:02 level I was going to be on what income
35:04 

35:04 level I'll be at like at what stage
35:06 

35:06 would I be married what stage I would
35:09 

35:09 have the first and then like it was just
35:11 

35:11 insane and that drove me um absolutely
35:14 

35:14 anxious when things didn't go my way and
35:17 

35:17 um yeah when you know things started
35:19 

35:19 becoming really like Rowdy and stuff
35:22 

35:22 like that chaotic in my life um I had to
35:25 

35:25 teach myself to be very present I'm also
35:27 

35:27 very lucky to have therapists that I
35:29 

35:29 work with that help me with like
35:30 

35:30 self-management skills to be uh more
35:33 

35:33 present and focused as well and just to
35:35 

35:35 take like opportunities as they go so
35:38 

35:38 yeah that's the one thing in terms of
35:39 

35:39 time management like uh you're living
35:41 

35:41 week to week I'm I'm living week to week
35:43 

35:43 day on day like I I literally don't know
35:46 

35:46 my schedule but that getes there there's
35:48 

35:48 a sort of like calm in that and that
35:52 

35:52 because I don't expect or anticipate
35:54 

35:54 anything yeah then you know I will I I
35:57 

35:57 have the confid confidence that I'll be
35:59 

35:59 able to find blocks of time and manage
36:01 

36:01 my time well so that's the first part
36:02 

36:02 it's the mindset going in it's just
36:04 

36:04 being really present the uh second part
36:07 

36:07 of it is um definitely having Google
36:09 

36:09 Calendar or some sort of like um event
36:11 

36:11 scheduling thing like helps I think like
36:14 

36:14 before I started being on a calendar of
36:16 

36:16 some sort that's that's when like I
36:18 

36:18 realized like things became really messy
36:20 

36:20 um so yeah tool wise definitely have
36:23 

36:23 some sort of thing yeah um I I think
36:26 

36:26 like uh the third part is um I I don't
36:31 

36:31 know how to kind of like explain but
36:34 

36:34 like when I do put time to something no
36:37 

36:37 matter how long or how short I make sure
36:39 

36:39 it's productive time so um when I have
36:42 

36:42 like a work task at hand and I say I
36:44 

36:44 want to do Focus work for the next 20
36:46 

36:46 minutes I feel like you practice this
36:48 

36:48 too there's nothing to distract me I
36:50 

36:50 will not allow anything um I I think
36:53 

36:53 like a lot of people when they say they
36:55 

36:55 work the whole day or they work work
36:57 

36:57 this amount of time they study this
36:58 

36:58 amount of time it's actually a very
36:59 

36:59 distractive time where they have their
37:01 

37:01 phones on and then they'll allow
37:02 

37:02 themselves to get out of the Flow State
37:04 

37:04 and then work so they end up not doing
37:05 

37:05 anything or watching like a Netflix like
37:07 

37:07 a drama a side I don't do that like when
37:10 

37:10 I allocate time for something um it's
37:13 

37:13 like 100% that one thing you know even
37:15 

37:15 100% like trying to like talk to someone
37:18 

37:18 also that um that's why in a day I can
37:21 

37:21 divide it very cleanly into even 20
37:23 

37:23 minutes it's valuable to me because I
37:25 

37:25 know I'm going to optimize the the heck
37:26 

37:26 out of the 20 minutes um and that's why
37:28 

37:28 I think like I can work at such high
37:30 

37:30 capacity in small time blocks because
37:33 

37:33 I'm devoting like 150% to it so that's
37:36 

37:36 one thing as so I I have a lot of things
37:38 

37:38 going on in a day in very small time
37:39 

37:39 blocks but I make use of every single
37:41 

37:41 second of it um I think the third one is
37:46 

37:46 um
37:47 

37:47 just I don't know like it's also not I
37:52 

37:52 don't consider things to take up my time
37:55 

37:55 every single like event task thing that
37:57 

37:57 I do is very valuable to me um meeting
38:00 

38:00 every single one person is very valuable
38:02 

38:02 to me and I know I'm going to take away
38:04 

38:04 with that learning something you know
38:06 

38:06 when I do something I take away with
38:07 

38:07 something so I think it's also like I
38:10 

38:10 don't have a concept of time and space
38:12 

38:12 you know I if I want to be there I will
38:15 

38:15 make all time to be there um for that
38:17 

38:17 event for that person um because I know
38:20 

38:20 I'm going to take something away from it
38:21 

38:21 it's also kind of like maybe my brain
38:23 

38:23 just doesn't like factor in time very
38:25 

38:25 well like literally I had to get like an
38:27 

38:27 analog clock over a digital one because
38:29 

38:29 like I need to be able to see how the
38:31 

38:31 hands like how far apart like one time
38:34 

38:34 is to another to kind of like visualize
38:36 

38:36 in my head that oh actually 5 minutes is
38:38 

38:38 is not a lot of
38:39 

38:39 time but yeah I think there's a lot more
38:43 

38:43 I could go into this but this is a good
38:45 

38:45 question I really need to sit down and
38:47 

38:47 think about it but gist of it that's
38:51 

38:51 that but maybe another episode I could
38:53 

38:53 think I could think better about this
38:54 

38:54 and give you a more structured answer
38:57 

38:57 yeah and actually before we wrap up I
38:59 

38:59 just have one more question because it
39:01 

39:01 seems like you're always so productive
39:02 

39:02 like you mentioned how you block time
39:04 

39:04 and you make sure everything that
39:06 

39:06 you% yeah so what does Natasha do for
39:10 

39:10 fun oh Natasha that's a lot hey a lot of
39:13 

39:13 the things I do like are are funun fun
39:15 

39:15 is like the incentive right like if I
39:17 

39:17 don't have fun in something I'm not
39:19 

39:19 going to do it because that's how I
39:20 

39:20 derive joy and meeting through things
39:22 

39:22 like this is really fun for me you know
39:24 

39:24 the moment something loses meaning and
39:26 

39:26 fun for me I will stop doing it and
39:28 

39:28 there will be no drive so you know fun
39:30 

39:30 is like you know fostering my uh the
39:32 

39:32 animals that I Foster you know fun is
39:35 

39:35 like working on this podcast with you
39:36 

39:36 guys fun is like when I'm climbing and
39:38 

39:38 also like socializing um through the
39:40 

39:40 climbing activity fun is also when I'm
39:42 

39:42 building projects you know everything is
39:45 

39:45 fun to me and the moment something stops
39:47 

39:47 being fun I make sure to vocalize it and
39:48 

39:48 I'll drop it like really quick if it
39:50 

39:50 stops becoming interesting to me so
39:53 

39:53 that's super great yeah but in terms of
39:54 

39:54 downtime though like if that's what
