00:00 as I progressed on in my career path I
00:03 

00:03 actually started working for companies
00:05 

00:05 that were more white skill So currently
00:08 

00:08 the one I'm working for is the most
00:11 

00:11 widest uh user base that I have which is
00:14 

00:14 the entire
00:16 

00:16 world what what are you doing like are
00:21 

00:21 [Music]
00:24 

00:24 you hi we're Rag tech the podcast for bytes
00:27 

00:27 and banter so in this episode we we are
00:30 

00:30 going to talk about Saloni before that we
00:33 

00:33 wanted to introduce ourselves first
00:35 

00:35 because we always somehow forget that
00:37 

00:37 I'm Natasha software engineer I'm Salone
00:39 

00:39 software engineer and I'm Victoria a
00:41 

00:41 Solutions engineer So today we're going
00:43 

00:43 to talk about Salon
00:46 

00:46 yay and so I think the first question we
00:49 

00:49 just want to segue into is that
00:51 

00:51 something that me and Natasha always
00:52 

00:52 notice about you and we just want to ask
00:54 

00:54 is why do you always wear a black shirt
00:57 

00:57 oh a black shirt okay uh many many
01:01 

01:01 reasons one of it is I think black makes
01:04 

01:04 me kind of invisible so I like that like
01:08 

01:08 you should see me for me my face and
01:12 

01:12 everything else is invisible and also
01:14 

01:14 like I think in in like the tech office
01:19 

01:19 it's easier to blend in if I'm not so
01:21 

01:21 colorful I don't know that's just my
01:24 

01:24 opinion also every morning when I do
01:27 

01:27 wake up I don't have to think about what
01:29 

01:29 I'm going to wear I know it's a black
01:30 

01:30 shirt with a black pants or with a black
01:33 

01:33 skirt so yeah it's just ease of choosing
01:37 

01:37 clothes so basically your uniform yeah
01:40 

01:40 it is my uniform it's like it's my tech
01:42 

01:42 uniform I do wear other colors at other
01:45 

01:45 places I've seen that I've seen that
01:48 

01:48 yeah so basically it sounds like you
01:52 

01:52 just don't want to think about you know
01:53 

01:53 what to wear and all that yeah just easy
01:55 

01:55 black shirt so you're like a female
01:57 

01:57 Steve Jobs you can say that I guess
02:01 

02:01 okay it's not everywhere that I'll wear
02:02 

02:02 my black shirt though yeah I do have
02:05 

02:05 colors okay Steve's a software engineer
02:08 

02:08 no but he's like a he like a Founder
02:10 

02:10 type you need to have the turtleneck if
02:11 

02:11 you want like be him but I guess so how
02:15 

02:15 many how many black shirts do you
02:17 

02:17 own uh not that many actually I I have
02:20 

02:20 about seven just rear the same one every
02:23 

02:23 single day right they are actually the
02:25 

02:25 exact same one but I have seven of the
02:27 

02:27 same ones wow because I one new one
02:31 

02:31 every day and also they're all from uni
02:35 

02:35 so at Uni
02:37 

02:37 everywhere if you want I'm kid yes uh
02:41 

02:41 uni CLA has like the the most
02:42 

02:42 comfortable shirts gu I agree with that
02:46 

02:46 it's very soft nice yeah so how does the
02:48 

02:48 black shirt help you in your day-to-day
02:50 

02:50 job as a software
02:53 

02:53 engineer I I just feel comfortable in it
02:56 

02:56 like yeah comfortable and and confident
03:00 

03:00 yeah because those are the two qualities
03:02 

03:02 that you require to be a software
03:03 

03:03 engineer but anyways back to the serious
03:05 

03:05 question okay yeah that was a fun
03:07 

03:07 question question I think like uh this
03:09 

03:09 episode we really wanted to talk about
03:11 

03:11 like Salone um and her experience in the
03:13 

03:13 tech industry and for Salone she's
03:15 

03:15 basically a software engineer she's the
03:17 

03:17 one who's had the most experience out of
03:19 

03:19 all three of us so Salone why don't you
03:21 

03:21 tell everybody how many years of
03:23 

03:23 experience do you have as a software
03:24 

03:24 engineer I have seven years of
03:27 

03:27 experience as a software develop I
03:30 

03:30 actually prefer the concept software
03:32 

03:32 developer what's the difference between
03:34 

03:34 developer and
03:35 

03:35 engineer I don't think there is a
03:37 

03:37 difference different companies call
03:40 

03:40 their employees differently but I don't
03:42 

03:42 think there's a difference per se I feel
03:44 

03:44 like I've read it in a book that like um
03:47 

03:47 a software developer is basically
03:49 

03:49 somebody who just like builds but a
03:50 

03:50 software engineer somebody who builds
03:52 

03:52 with skill in mind I think this was in
03:54 

03:54 like Jean Kim's like devop handbook or
03:56 

03:56 something like that I can't remember but
03:58 

03:58 you think I have I read some something
03:60 

03:60 like this as well but I mean nowadays I
04:03 

04:03 don't know who's not building for skill
04:05 

04:05 anymore that's true at least I have
04:08 

04:08 skill in mind all the time whatever I'm
04:10 

04:10 building so yeah I guess yeah depends
04:13 

04:13 person to person yeah that's true but
04:15 

04:15 you did say that you would call yourself
04:17 

04:17 a developer over an engineer so why is
04:20 

04:20 that when it's the
04:21 

04:21 same I just prefer the developer and not
04:24 

04:24 an not an engineer engineer is like very
04:28 

04:28 I don't like mechanical engineer
04:30 

04:30 Hardware involvement I that's how I
04:33 

04:33 perceive it you don't want to like
04:36 

04:36 freaking like screw all electrical light
04:39 

04:39 bulbs like be an electrical engineer in
04:41 

04:41 the first episode when you talked about
04:42 

04:42 as the years pass I have changed a lot
04:45 

04:45 and this is what I think now you have
04:47 

04:47 become her wise I would like to think
04:50 

04:50 so I see I see yeah yeah so as someone
04:54 

04:54 who's been in the industry for really
04:57 

04:57 long time um what has your been your
04:60 

04:60 journey been like so
05:02 

05:02 far uh I would say I have a very
05:06 

05:06 traditional career Journey as a software
05:09 

05:09 developer so I graduated with computer
05:11 

05:11 science uh and I got my first job right
05:14 

05:14 after as a com as a software
05:17 

05:17 developer and and then I switched
05:19 

05:19 companies every two years but always in
05:22 

05:22 the core software development
05:24 

05:24 role and yeah it's just always building
05:28 

05:28 uh Building Systems for the company and
05:33 

05:33 it has been very backend oriented but in
05:37 

05:37 some of the companies that I did work
05:38 

05:38 for there was some front end involved so
05:41 

05:41 I do call myself a fullstack developer
05:44 

05:44 MH where full stack is for those who
05:46 

05:46 don't know fullstack developers would be
05:48 

05:48 someone who can do both front end design
05:52 

05:52 so the websites face uh client facing
05:54 

05:54 end as well as the backend databases
05:58 

05:58 servers involved as well
06:00 

06:00 so yeah I'm a I'm a full stack developer
06:03 

06:03 and yeah so mostly doing backend heavy
06:07 

06:07 jobs and I think every full stack
06:09 

06:09 developer does lean to one of it so for
06:12 

06:12 me based on the demands of the job and
06:14 

06:14 the company that you're at correct and
06:15 

06:15 also your interest you would naturally
06:17 

06:17 lean towards one you can't be the Best
06:19 

06:19 of Both Worlds that's true yeah you
06:21 

06:21 would be better at one and you will lean
06:23 

06:23 towards one as well so for me that would
06:25 

06:25 be backend development mhm and uh I mean
06:30 

06:30 yeah so mostly dealing with a lot of
06:32 

06:32 exposing apis and uh ensuring
06:36 

06:36 scalability as well so as I progressed
06:39 

06:39 on in my career path I actually started
06:41 

06:41 working for companies that were more uh
06:44 

06:44 White skill So currently the one I'm
06:46 

06:46 working for is the most widest uh user
06:50 

06:50 base that I have which is the entire
06:54 

06:54 world what what are you doing like are
06:58 

06:58 you building the internet the World
07:00 

07:00 building the internet that's a big big
07:03 

07:03 ask yeah I me not the entire world I I
07:06 

07:06 would say a couple million million users
07:09 

07:09 right right so yeah I mean in my world
07:11 

07:11 that's the entire world is there like a
07:13 

07:13 particular industry you're you're
07:15 

07:15 targeting for like your next company cuz
07:17 

07:17 you mentioned how you change companies
07:18 

07:18 every two years is it like always like a
07:21 

07:21 company that's within the tax Bas like
07:23 

07:23 heavily so this uh 2 years company
07:26 

07:26 change wasn't an intentional thing uh it
07:29 

07:29 just so happened that I found that I've
07:33 

07:33 uh reaped everything I don't know that's
07:35 

07:35 if I've received everything that I could
07:37 

07:37 from that job and I have given my all as
07:38 

07:38 well and then that's when I was just
07:41 

07:41 just nice it was 2 years uh I'm
07:44 

07:44 currently in a good space I would say
07:46 

07:46 that there are still things that I will
07:49 

07:49 learn and I want to learn and where I
07:51 

07:51 can even show my skills so and uh
07:55 

07:55 currently I'm in a fintech and I am
07:58 

07:58 loving it cuz
07:60 

07:60 I love Finance I love as I have
08:03 

08:03 mentioned many times love money I love
08:05 

08:05 money and I love Tech so I'm in a
08:08 

08:08 fintech company so I I do get the best
08:11 

08:11 of both all I do get to see money moving
08:13 

08:13 around and uh use my tech skills on this
08:17 

08:17 so if if I do uh do switch to another
08:21 

08:21 comp it would still be a fin Tech I
08:23 

08:23 would say right right so you finally
08:25 

08:25 found that sweet spot that you really
08:28 

08:28 enjoy uh I I haven't seen all the
08:30 

08:30 industries yet I have seen I've worked
08:32 

08:32 for the government I've worked for uh
08:36 

08:36 mainly government yes and could I know
08:39 

08:39 that education edch sort of edch yeah
08:43 

08:43 and iot MH and then uh the last couple
08:47 

08:47 of years has been fintech right and yeah
08:50 

08:50 I like I like the fintech space so do
08:53 

08:53 you think it was intentional for you to
08:55 

08:55 kind of like as you switch jobs you
08:56 

08:56 switch across domains or is it um more
08:59 

08:59 of like as you switch jobs you're also
09:01 

09:01 learning for new skills within like the
09:04 

09:04 uh technical role that you're in maybe
09:05 

09:05 the first one was more front end and
09:07 

09:07 you're looking for something more
09:08 

09:08 backend like how was that thought
09:11 

09:11 process for you as you changed um jobs
09:13 

09:13 along the way so for me like my uh the
09:17 

09:17 most highest important factor wouldn't
09:19 

09:19 be the teex stack per se I'm open to
09:23 

09:23 multitude of Tex text but there's
09:25 

09:25 something I do look for and even
09:27 

09:27 industry I don't particularly look for a
09:29 

09:29 certain industry I'm open to various
09:32 

09:32 Industries and I would I would like to
09:34 

09:34 be in different Industries to experience
09:36 

09:36 all before choosing one to focus on yeah
09:40 

09:40 so it just so happened that I got into
09:42 

09:42 the different Industries in the
09:44 

09:44 beginning uh but one thing I do look for
09:46 

09:46 when I'm switching is the company values
09:49 

09:49 itself oh so like the culture the the
09:53 

09:53 work life balance that they have the
09:56 

09:56 value they are providing to yeah end
09:60 

09:60 users to the end users uh things like
10:03 

10:03 that and yeah like the people I'm going
10:05 

10:05 to be interacting I love it when
10:07 

10:07 companies allow me to talk to my team
10:09 

10:09 directly so certain companies allow that
10:12 

10:12 they actually what do you mean allow
10:13 

10:13 like like just like there are companies
10:15 

10:15 that ban you like no don't talk to your
10:16 

10:16 team no before the interview ends you
10:20 

10:20 know like I'm still in the interview
10:22 

10:22 process you're in an interview face yeah
10:23 

10:23 I was just going to ask you like how do
10:25 

10:25 you kind of like understand the culture
10:27 

10:27 and the values that a company as spouses
10:29 

10:29 like before you even get to the job like
10:31 

10:31 so correct so it's it's true interview
10:33 

10:33 so I've learned this so uh even now
10:36 

10:36 actually I do believe in this that uh
10:39 

10:39 you should always be interview ready so
10:41 

10:41 at various points in my life I would
10:43 

10:43 just go for interviews for the sake of
10:46 

10:46 being up there to be ready for interview
10:50 

10:50 be ready for interview so that I know
10:52 

10:52 what what are the what um the company's
10:54 

10:54 looking for these days I don't want to
10:56 

10:56 be you know on the on the rear end of
10:59 

10:59 the chain
10:60 

10:60 I always like to be on in front so I do
11:02 

11:02 go for interviews every now and then I
11:05 

11:05 don't know if I'm going to be penalized
11:06 

11:06 for saying that but I mean but if
11:08 

11:08 there's a good offer why not uh I do
11:11 

11:11 accept accept it as well but yeah I do
11:14 

11:14 go for interviews every now and then and
11:17 

11:17 through these interviews I kind of
11:18 

11:18 mastered I don't think I've mastered it
11:20 

11:20 but I kind of got how I can get my the
11:23 

11:23 the factors I want out uh so it's not
11:26 

11:26 just an interview where the interview is
11:27 

11:27 interviewing me I'm also inter in them
11:30 

11:30 right I look at it that way so they ask
11:33 

11:33 me questions I will always ask them
11:35 

11:35 questions as well what kind of questions
11:37 

11:37 do you ask them actually uh and when do
11:39 

11:39 you ask them not story when so like
11:42 

11:42 every every interview round they do
11:44 

11:44 encourage you to ask questions so you
11:45 

11:45 should ask questions it's just that ask
11:48 

11:48 the good don't just ask book questions
11:50 

11:50 you know those questions that are on
11:51 

11:51 Google that you should ask these kind of
11:53 

11:53 questions know what you're asking
11:55 

11:55 intentionally and then receive the
11:57 

11:57 response that way so I would ask like if
11:60 

11:60 it's a tech lead who's interviewing me I
12:02 

12:02 would try to ask like how is your day
12:05 

12:05 to-day like how is your relationship
12:08 

12:08 with the other members on your team oh
12:10 

12:10 that's a good question uh things like
12:12 

12:12 that and how much do you value
12:16 

12:16 mentorship over
12:18 

12:18 selflearning things like that so like
12:20 

12:20 there there are certain things I'll just
12:23 

12:23 ask um and uh there was this even one
12:26 

12:26 interview where where I asked
12:29 

12:29 I usually do ask this question I do ask
12:31 

12:31 the female male ratio in the in the
12:34 

12:34 teams the engineering teams so then uh
12:38 

12:38 the person was like oh there aren't many
12:40 

12:40 actually there's only like three out of
12:42 

12:42 like how many we have uh and then I was
12:46 

12:46 like oh why do you think it is so wa
12:48 

12:48 you're really interview when you say
12:50 

12:50 interview ready it's like I'm the
12:51 

12:51 interviewer and I'm ready for you um it
12:54 

12:54 depends sometimes I am confident enough
12:56 

12:56 to ask such questions sometimes I'm not
12:59 

12:59 as well you know it depends on my level
13:02 

13:02 of uh casualness with the interviewer
13:05 

13:05 right right it's also about how you Vibe
13:07 

13:07 with the interviewer if you're bold
13:08 

13:08 enough to ask those questions it
13:10 

13:10 probably means the culture is kind of
13:11 

13:11 like there corre yeah and also like the
13:13 

13:13 response it indicates something right
13:15 

13:15 like if if the person responds with like
13:18 

13:18 oh that's because there aren't that many
13:21 

13:21 good female software Engineers so that's
13:24 

13:24 that's like a big red flag like so you
13:28 

13:28 know why I mean yes I can join you and
13:30 

13:30 try to prove myself but why would I do
13:32 

13:32 that you know like exactly I'm sure you
13:35 

13:35 have seen good female software
13:37 

13:37 developers there are out there it's
13:40 

13:40 something sometimes it's in your mind
13:42 

13:42 that you you like blocked off that's
13:44 

13:44 really important because I think a lot
13:46 

13:46 of people who are new and trying to find
13:48 

13:48 interviews they think they should be the
13:50 

13:50 one that fits into the company but not
13:52 

13:52 finding a company that fits them so by
13:54 

13:54 you asking these questions you're
13:56 

13:56 actually finding a company that fits you
13:58 

13:58 as well your values so I think that's
13:60 

14:00 really good and talking about this is
14:03 

14:03 that how like you kind of develop your
14:04 

14:04 interview ready series you know oh yes I
14:07 

14:07 so I started a interview ready series
14:09 

14:09 for women cot I used the platform to so
14:13 

14:13 women cot is a community that uh that is
14:16 

14:16 run in Singapore and I am a speaker in
14:19 

14:19 one of the series where it's an
14:20 

14:20 interview ready series started by me
14:22 

14:22 where every month or so I would do a
14:25 

14:25 mock interview of a there different
14:28 

14:28 interview rounds for a software deer so
14:30 

14:30 I'll do one in each month that is also a
14:34 

14:34 one of the ways I make myself interview
14:36 

14:36 ready by and not attend an actual
14:38 

14:38 interview at a company cuz it is
14:40 

14:40 draining sometimes to be you know
14:42 

14:42 talking to a stranger but doing mock
14:45 

14:45 interviews I would do it like with a
14:47 

14:47 friend of mine like yourself or yeah so
14:50 

14:50 that's much easier and I it still lets
14:52 

14:52 me be on top of my knowledge and
14:55 

14:55 Concepts mhh and also as I always say
14:58 

14:58 teaching is the best way to learn it
14:60 

14:60 actually forces me to question a lot of
15:02 

15:02 things like why do I do certain things a
15:04 

15:04 certain way mhmh uh so yeah that's
15:07 

15:07 that's one of the reasons I wanted to
15:08 

15:08 promote the culture of being interview
15:10 

15:10 ready CU to reach the state of where you
15:13 

15:13 can ask these kind of questions to an
15:14 

15:14 interviewer you have to be you have to
15:17 

15:17 know that you are of a certain caliber
15:19 

15:19 right like you need to have some
15:21 

15:21 confidence in yourself you can't be like
15:23 

15:23 a lower and average software do your and
15:25 

15:25 still be asking such big questions like
15:27 

15:27 oh who are you so so so I I was at that
15:31 

15:31 place I tried I practiced I gained
15:34 

15:34 confidence by doing these kind of things
15:37 

15:37 uh so I would say I'm a average to a
15:40 

15:40 little above average software developers
15:42 

15:42 where I can demand such kind of factors
15:46 

15:46 in a company yeah and I can actually
15:48 

15:48 also deny certain companies right like
15:51 

15:51 reject them that no I do not want I do
15:53 

15:53 not want to join you where for some
15:55 

15:55 people it's not the case they don't
15:57 

15:57 always have a choice yeah for sure sure
15:59 

15:59 yeah I also love what you said that like
16:02 

16:02 you always say say this but teaching is
16:04 

16:04 the best way of learning and the fact
16:06 

16:06 that you did like the interview ready
16:08 

16:08 series you're preparing yourself but
16:10 

16:10 you're teaching that to the world as
16:11 

16:11 well through that media and I think
16:13 

16:13 that's really valuable do you think like
16:15 

16:15 it's because of this value that you kind
16:17 

16:17 of hold dear to yourself that you've
16:18 

16:18 kind of advanced yourself so much as a
16:20 

16:20 software engineer it definitely helped
16:22 

16:22 me uh in in my Learning Journey uh where
16:27 

16:27 I want to be interview ready so I learn
16:29 

16:29 a lot of things on my own to get up
16:31 

16:31 there and then give it to the others as
16:34 

16:34 well so yeah uh yeah I and I know like
16:38 

16:38 one of the things you really like to do
16:40 

16:40 is actually you advocate for par
16:41 

16:41 programming a lot yeah yeah not not so
16:45 

16:45 much in the in the recent past okay yeah
16:48 

16:48 but do you want to kind of like talk
16:49 

16:49 about what par programming is and try to
16:51 

16:51 relate that to people who might not know
16:53 

16:53 what it is uh sure yeah so pair
16:55 

16:55 programming is something I learned uh
16:57 

16:57 during my time at to Works uh
16:59 

16:59 thoughtworks is a company which promotes
17:02 

17:02 a lot of uh good developer skills like
17:06 

17:06 tdd test driven development pair
17:08 

17:08 programming is one of it uh there's
17:10 

17:10 extreme programming and things like that
17:13 

17:13 so pair programming uh this very lay men
17:17 

17:17 lay women understanding of of uh what
17:21 

17:21 PIR programming is but it is to me it is
17:23 

17:23 two developers sitting together and
17:26 

17:26 working on a ticket item so we would
17:30 

17:30 first discuss okay what are we going to
17:32 

17:32 do and uh so usually when we do p
17:36 

17:36 programming we would also do tdd test
17:38 

17:38 driven development so we'll actually
17:39 

17:39 write proper very simple tests the other
17:43 

17:43 person would implement the the test
17:46 

17:46 scenario and make it pass write another
17:48 

17:48 test make it pass and uh iteratively get
17:52 

17:52 to the actual ticket item itself and
17:56 

17:56 then do like a round of refactoring
17:58 

17:58 wherever it's needed
17:59 

17:59 and then you should be able to now merge
18:02 

18:02 your code you do not need a review
18:05 

18:05 another level of review again you had
18:07 

18:07 somebody review it two pairs of eyes
18:10 

18:10 reviewing it already but of course there
18:12 

18:12 various versions of this there are also
18:14 

18:14 you can do it the other way where you
18:15 

18:15 implement first test later or do it
18:18 

18:18 together things like that or one person
18:20 

18:20 is just a typer and the other person
18:24 

18:24 without using the you have to like sit
18:26 

18:26 on your hand and you just be like okay
18:28 

18:28 what about we implement this function
18:30 

18:30 which does this and then the other
18:31 

18:31 person implements it it's just a verbal
18:33 

18:33 and a typ of would you say that's for
18:36 

18:36 more like senior um like Engineers to
18:40 

18:40 kind of do yeah so yeah so exactly so
18:42 

18:42 that's when the different seniority
18:44 

18:44 comes into play of the pair so that it
18:46 

18:46 could be two Juniors a senior a junior
18:49 

18:49 two
18:50 

18:50 seniors uh but it it does it involve a
18:53 

18:53 lot of collaboration and ability to
18:56 

18:56 accept uh criticism have a proper
18:60 

18:60 discussion like not be too opinion I do
19:03 

19:03 it this way all the time I want to do it
19:05 

19:05 this way understand why the other person
19:07 

19:07 does things the other way yeah yeah
19:09 

19:09 exactly so there's a lot of learnings
19:11 

19:11 involved it does slow the process of you
19:13 

19:13 doing it by yourself but maybe as a
19:16 

19:16 whole the the feature that you have not
19:18 

19:18 produced is much more higher quality cuz
19:20 

19:20 you bounced off Pro of so many different
19:24 

19:24 yeah and I think it's actually like
19:26 

19:26 because you practice this so much and
19:27 

19:27 it's also kind of like widely practice
19:29 

19:29 in the tech industry as a whole I think
19:32 

19:32 it's been such a comfortable kind of
19:33 

19:33 like working experience with both of you
19:35 

19:35 on this podcast cuz we've been kind of
19:38 

19:38 basically doing that because we do this
19:40 

19:40 at our own time right so when it comes
19:42 

19:42 to trying to optimize our time we're not
19:44 

19:44 holding back our constructive criticism
19:46 

19:46 we kind of give give each other
19:47 

19:47 immediate objective feedback when it
19:49 

19:49 comes to like the video editing so it's
19:50 

19:50 really not just about like par
19:53 

19:53 programming that's specific to like the
19:55 

19:55 tech world I feel like I've been able to
19:58 

19:58 carry this culture outside and be really
20:00 

20:00 honest open and also very receptive to
20:03 

20:03 feedback and I think that that kind of
20:05 

20:05 shows in our dynamic as well yeah like
20:07 

20:07 talking about that example where we also
20:10 

20:10 give uh feedback to each other we also
20:12 

20:12 have to remember that we are a team we
20:14 

20:14 are working towards one goal like exact
20:17 

20:17 you know for example make re Tech
20:19 

20:19 perfect so whatever your feedback is I
20:22 

20:22 have to take it with the perception that
20:24 

20:24 you are coming from an angle of making
20:26 

20:26 it perfect and it's something I want to
20:28 

20:28 do too so I would then act on it because
20:30 

20:30 yes that makes sense it is leading to
20:32 

20:32 that that end goal so the same thing
20:34 

20:34 with P programming no one you you should
20:37 

20:37 it's a way of thinking as well like
20:39 

20:39 where is the person coming from right
20:41 

20:41 right are we both working towards this
20:43 

20:43 product uh that yeah definitely there's
20:46 

20:46 no ill intention with that right like
20:48 

20:48 it's a win-win scenario MH yeah but uh
20:50 

20:50 since in my experience there are also
20:52 

20:52 some developers who can't do pair
20:55 

20:55 programming like they are against it
20:57 

20:57 which is completely all right right
20:59 

20:59 against it many reasons maybe it's not
21:02 

21:02 done properly the first time so they
21:03 

21:03 have a bad experience or uh very
21:07 

21:07 opiniated so you would not want to
21:10 

21:10 collaborate MH so it depends on the team
21:13 

21:13 the culture yeah yeah and how it works
21:15 

21:15 but I definitely like the when I when I
21:18 

21:18 see the most benefit of PIR programming
21:20 

21:20 is when someone is on boarding to your
21:22 

21:22 team oh yeah that's true yeah for them
21:25 

21:25 to on board to not just say you know
21:27 

21:27 your uh daily software practices but
21:30 

21:30 also to the teams culture because that's
21:32 

21:32 how you interact them with teams culture
21:33 

21:33 the domain knowledge itself like that's
21:35 

21:35 a very good way to start on a ticket
21:38 

21:38 with a new person like okay so this is
21:41 

21:41 how it is this is the introduction of
21:43 

21:43 things this is where I would make the
21:44 

21:44 changes mhm and yeah like you also kind
21:48 

21:48 of become like buddy buddy with the
21:49 

21:49 person yeah yeah I also think this whole
21:51 

21:51 conversation is really good cuz I think
21:53 

21:53 a lot of my um perhaps non-technical
21:55 

21:55 folks think software engineering
21:57 

21:57 engineering Tech in general is a very
21:58 

21:58 lonely kind of like Endeavor that's how
22:01 

22:01 the media usually portrays it and even
22:03 

22:03 though we talk about like you know we
22:04 

22:04 develop our own games we de develop our
22:06 

22:06 own side projects but really the idea of
22:09 

22:09 like um working in a team is so
22:11 

22:11 important and that's what differentiates
22:13 

22:13 like you know um a person doing
22:15 

22:15 University uh projects for example from
22:18 

22:18 like somebody who has actually worked on
22:20 

22:20 uh software on at scale and like a
22:23 

22:23 larger team and a larger company that's
22:25 

22:25 a different set of skills and it's way
22:27 

22:27 softer like you talk about soft skills a
22:29 

22:29 lot right yeah it's not really just
22:31 

22:31 about the hard skills of knowing how to
22:32 

22:32 code it's about like how do you code
22:34 

22:34 with people yeah because at the end of
22:36 

22:36 the day you're not doing a solo project
22:37 

22:37 you have to merge your code into
22:39 

22:39 somebody else's like imagine working on
22:40 

22:40 a Microsoft work doc document or like
22:43 

22:43 more Google Sheets wait gole Google
22:46 

22:46 Google Docs I don't even know but
22:48 

22:48 imagine doing that but with 10 different
22:49 

22:49 people
22:50 

22:50 simultaneously you know you're going to
22:52 

22:52 clash for sure so how do you manage you
22:54 

22:54 know that kind of like People to People
22:56 

22:56 Communications how do you manage like
22:57 

22:57 onboarding to new team members like you
22:60 

22:60 said who don't know who who won't know
23:01 

23:01 the context of your word document how do
23:03 

23:03 you like uh ascertain that the tone of
23:05 

23:05 the word document like Remains the Same
23:08 

23:08 you one uses passive tense and then one
23:10 

23:10 uses like something else that's going to
23:11 

23:11 look weird so I think this is the part
23:13 

23:13 that I was really glad that we are
23:15 

23:15 talking about it because then like I
23:17 

23:17 hope like it helps people understand
23:19 

23:19 that it's not like collabration is
23:21 

23:21 definitely like a something that people
23:23 

23:23 tend to overlook when they go into Tech
23:25 

23:25 they always think that it's a lone wolf
23:27 

23:27 kind of thing right so I'm glad we
23:29 

23:29 highlight that I think that's quite
23:31 

23:31 important to um emphasize on
23:33 

23:33 collaboration and how often actually in
23:36 

23:36 your day-to-day lives that like yeah
23:38 

23:38 even outside of tech that you know you
23:40 

23:40 need to know how to collaborate with
23:42 

23:42 people and it's not just software
23:44 

23:44 engineer you're a Solutions engineer
23:46 

23:46 like you you definitely work in a team
23:47 

23:47 like we collaborate across teams as well
23:49 

23:49 not just team our own team but also like
23:53 

23:53 product team sales team you know and
23:55 

23:55 across different roles as well right
23:57 

23:57 yeah so understanding like how to
23:59 

23:59 communicate effectively across like I
24:02 

24:02 wouldn't be so technical to sales people
24:04 

24:04 right I might be more technical to
24:06 

24:06 product team but not so much to salese
24:08 

24:08 so understanding what is their business
24:11 

24:11 objectives and speak in the same lingual
24:13 

24:13 is quite important and I like how you
24:15 

24:15 mentioned about how prir programming
24:16 

24:16 actually helps with onboarding because
24:18 

24:18 actually when I first joined this
24:20 

24:20 company I also start pair programming
24:22 

24:22 with someone oh right and that actually
24:23 

24:23 helps you to just you know understand
24:26 

24:26 and learn things quicker right so I
24:28 

24:28 think that's part of like you know if
24:29 

24:29 you pair program with someone they
24:31 

24:31 understand the code Bas faster as well
24:33 

24:33 it will help the entire team so having
24:34 

24:34 that win-win group think mindset is
24:37 

24:37 actually quite essential as a software
24:39 

24:39 that's also how I actually uh learned a
24:41 

24:41 lot of shortcuts on the edit CU a lot of
24:45 

24:45 people would do it and I'm like oh wait
24:47 

24:47 why did you just press so actually I
24:48 

24:48 want to ask you know as someone who's
24:49 

24:49 super experienced right how important it
24:52 

24:52 is to know all the visual studi code
24:55 

24:55 shortcuts cuz I learned quite a you when
24:58 

24:58 I just started you know cuz I thought I
25:00 

25:00 need to know but how important like is
25:02 

25:02 vim also necessary for for those you who
25:04 

25:04 don't know by the way like um visual
25:06 

25:06 Studios code is basically like it's the
25:09 

25:09 space where you edit and you write your
25:10 

25:10 code it's a code editor it's a code
25:12 

25:12 editor but but yeah we're talking about
25:14 

25:14 shortcuts in the sense that how you
25:15 

25:15 control V like control C but with a load
25:19 

25:19 more keyboard commands so any tips for
25:22 

25:22 that so I'm a Java developer and I use
25:26 

25:26 intellig intell oh yeah so but same
25:30 

25:30 thing also code editor U so for a long
25:34 

25:34 time in my years of coding I was not
25:38 

25:38 able to remember the C the shortcuts but
25:41 

25:41 people around me would use it and they
25:42 

25:42 were much much faster and it was a thing
25:45 

25:45 like they don't use the mouse at all
25:48 

25:48 just everything is V keyboard it was so
25:51 

25:51 cool uh I I have still not mastered it
25:55 

25:55 but I do know certain shortcuts and it
25:57 

25:57 does make your your life so so much
25:59 

25:59 easier for example even like my favorite
26:02 

26:02 shortcut would be going back a few files
26:05 

26:05 that you just touched like usually you
26:07 

26:07 be like oh wait where is that tab there
26:08 

26:08 a shortcut for that yeah there is a
26:10 

26:10 shortcut for that what's the shortcut I
26:12 

26:12 mean on intell it would be like command
26:15 

26:15 shift e or something okay okay but I'm
26:18 

26:18 sure there's a equivalent one for vs
26:20 

26:20 code and like there's one for like
26:21 

26:21 finding any file you can just open any
26:23 

26:23 file so like command shift o would be
26:26 

26:26 and then type the file name
26:28 

26:28 M uh things like that so super easy and
26:31 

26:31 it just makes you a bit more efficient M
26:34 

26:34 so yes efficiency wise it is good to
26:38 

26:38 have shortcuts but you will also not
26:41 

26:41 fail in life if you don't know the
26:42 

26:42 shortcuts it's just efficiency and like
26:45 

26:45 you know if if you are like bothered by
26:47 

26:47 using the mouse or like the keypad yeah
26:50 

26:50 definitely I've seen like really
26:51 

26:51 experienced ones they use Vim so oh yes
26:54 

26:54 so whm is another one that one You
26:56 

26:56 definitely don't need a mouse at all do
26:58 

26:58 you want to explain what Vim is uh Vim
27:01 

27:01 is another type of editor where
27:04 

27:04 everything okay I don't I've never
27:06 

27:06 explained it nor read a definition of it
27:09 

27:09 but I'll just describe it you can there
27:13 

27:13 is no cursor of the mouse that is just
27:17 

27:17 the editor line so you just type and
27:20 

27:20 there are shortcuts to like move ahead
27:22 

27:22 move back highlight things for you all
27:25 

27:25 via keyboard shortcut so it's a keyboard
27:29 

27:29 editor kind of thing yeah so do you use
27:32 

27:32 it uh I don't use it out of uh my own
27:36 

27:36 willingness but certain things do happen
27:39 

27:39 like git for example I only use it for
27:41 

27:41 like uh the G commit messages and stuff
27:43 

27:43 like that just because it was on default
27:45 

27:45 and I was just like I'm too lazy to
27:47 

27:47 change the default yeah I think BM you
27:50 

27:50 people should know like the most
27:53 

27:53 basic yeah yeah for sure it's basically
27:55 

27:55 what you see in movies right like the
27:57 

27:57 coder comes up and all he does is like
27:59 

27:59 half that black command start typing a
28:02 

28:02 command into it and he starts running
28:03 

28:03 all these yeah yeah no like you're
28:06 

28:06 scared at a hacker like doing that on
28:08 

28:08 the on a movies like we're scared when
28:09 

28:09 we see developers do that like no that's
28:12 

28:12 not us yeah for sure but no well the
28:15 

28:15 only shortcuts that I use are crol C and
28:17 

28:17 control V like I am such a purist I'm
28:20 

28:20 vanilla all the way but but there is one
28:23 

28:23 really really useful one where you can
28:25 

28:25 highlight multi line I think it's called
28:27 

28:27 m
28:28 

28:28 I've seen that where you can then add a
28:30 

28:30 comma in every single line or like a
28:32 

28:32 semicolon in every sing that's actually
28:34 

28:34 so useful yeah yeah so that is the one
28:37 

28:37 that I really appreciate the the
28:40 

28:40 shortcut for MH uh but yeah otherwise
28:42 

28:42 everything else is just a click away
28:44 

28:44 yeah yeah but for sure the shortcuts
28:46 

28:46 don't Define your experience as a
28:48 

28:48 software engineer right yeah being like
28:51 

28:51 an experience and more senior software
28:52 

28:52 engineer like you definitely don't
28:54 

28:54 Define your experiences in shortcuts but
28:57 

28:57 at many software developers I know do
28:59 

28:59 not know a lot of the shortcuts yeah
29:01 

29:01 yeah I mean it's just something like you
29:02 

29:02 said to make things more efficient but
29:04 

29:04 you know in your years as a software
29:06 

29:06 engineer like those are not the things
29:08 

29:08 that define you it's about the way you
29:10 

29:10 kind of learn from others the way you
29:11 

29:11 kind of work in a team I I would say one
29:14 

29:14 thing that defines a senior software Eng
29:16 

29:16 would be the code structure code design
29:21 

29:21 what's using usage of design patterns uh
29:25 

29:25 like the ability to know that in the
29:27 

29:27 future would be another similar feature
29:29 

29:29 so make it into in a way that allows you
29:32 

29:32 to easily add more code later and make
29:34 

29:34 it work for longterm things like that
29:37 

29:37 yeah yeah basically desig things at
29:40 

29:40 scale so yeah design itself forward
29:42 

29:42 looking basically yeah yeah you're
29:44 

29:44 thinking on behalf of the team rather
29:46 

29:46 than for yourself so when you're
29:47 

29:47 actually like coach you're not just like
29:49 

29:49 Solly thinking I just want to complete
29:51 

29:51 this uh ticket you know you're thinking
29:53 

29:53 of like when I complete this ticket I
29:55 

29:55 want to make sure that um other like
29:58 

29:58 team members will be able to easily come
29:59 

29:59 in simple things like comments even
30:01 

30:01 simple things like documentation that
30:03 

30:03 comes into your field also like I I saw
30:06 

30:06 on your um LinkedIn buyer you say I like
30:08 

30:08 the clean code or something refactory oh
30:10 

30:10 yes I like I like cleaning code it it
30:12 

30:12 gives me some certain satisfaction do
30:14 

30:14 you want to talk about what cleaning
30:15 

30:15 code
30:16 

30:16 means people all like what do you mean
30:18 

30:18 like clean your screen yeah so cleaning
30:20 

30:20 code means so code can so yeah you can
30:24 

30:24 you can write code in many different
30:27 

30:27 ways and and certain ways of writing
30:29 

30:29 code makes it a bit easier for you to
30:31 

30:31 like read through and understand what's
30:32 

30:32 happening and some it could be a bit
30:34 

30:34 convoluted like this links to that file
30:36 

30:36 that file LS to here and so we call that
30:38 

30:38 spaghetti code so cleaning code would be
30:41 

30:41 to untangle the spaghetti and making it
30:43 

30:43 making it very easy to read easy to
30:46 

30:46 understand easy to extend the code as
30:49 

30:49 well y so that that's what I meant by I
30:52 

30:52 like cleaning code yeah yeah B
30:54 

30:54 minimizing minimizing like not
30:56 

30:56 necessarily minimizing sometimes you're
30:58 

30:58 actually writing more code but you're
30:59 

30:59 actually trying to make it more modular
31:01 

31:01 or you're trying to make it like you
31:03 

31:03 know instead of having one super long
31:05 

31:05 line of cat you're trying to break it
31:07 

31:07 down yeah I think people also call this
31:08 

31:08 other than spaghetti coat like smelly
31:10 

31:10 coat I think that's where the term comes
31:13 

31:13 from yeah I don't know why we have that
31:14 

31:14 term but coat smell is Right
31:17 

31:17 smell yeah I think when I first heard it
31:20 

31:20 I was like what and then I was just like
31:23 

31:23 okay I get it now again cuz this Co SM
31:26 

31:26 yeah and this is like an interesting
31:28 

31:28 Insight that I got from my non-technical
31:30 

31:30 friend is that um he thinks that the
31:33 

31:33 longer the lines of code is the better
31:36 

31:36 no yeah so like before when I was
31:39 

31:39 writing an app for him and then he was
31:41 

31:41 like saying how many lines of code like
31:43 

31:43 he judge the code quality based on the
31:46 

31:46 number of lines so he thinks of it like
31:48 

31:48 an essay right so the more lines you
31:50 

31:50 write the more complicated or the more
31:53 

31:53 complete the code is so when he asked me
31:56 

31:56 at first like this is my use case can
31:57 

31:57 you help me build a website with all
31:59 

31:59 these user stories and I say okay sure I
32:02 

32:02 can do that and then he's like how many
32:03 

32:03 lines of code do you think there will be
32:05 

32:05 that like that's how he judged yeah so
32:07 

32:07 it's really good that you mentioned this
32:09 

32:09 cuz when I was trying to explain clean
32:11 

32:11 code for him I couldn't articulate it as
32:14 

32:14 well as you I just kind of saying it
32:17 

32:17 it's not about the length right like I
32:19 

32:19 say it could be less or more like I
32:21 

32:21 don't know um but yeah the fact that you
32:24 

32:24 articulated so well I think that really
32:26 

32:26 helps like I can defitely show him this
32:28 

32:28 video and yeah yeah exactly it's really
32:30 

32:30 about making it understandable to other
32:33 

32:33 members of your team other members who
32:35 

32:35 haven't even onboarded to your team as
32:37 

32:37 well as making it editable by other
32:39 

32:39 people you're basically trying to make
32:40 

32:40 yourself like dispensable like if I
32:42 

32:42 leave the team like other people can I
32:44 

32:44 also want to tell him about like robust
32:47 

32:47 code what it means but like that is also
32:49 

32:49 hard to Define like to non techies right
32:52 

32:52 yeah like is there a way since you
32:54 

32:54 defined clean code so well code yeah
32:58 

32:58 what so I I guess a very well well
33:01 

33:01 tested code would be a robust code yeah
33:03 

33:03 yeah it holds the strength of like any
33:06 

33:06 edge cases comes in it is able to
33:09 

33:09 gracefully handle
33:10 

33:10 it okay okay that's a good one I maybe
33:14 

33:14 maybe in a new episode we could like
33:16 

33:16 really delve into these like random
33:18 

33:18 technical words like I just realized how
33:20 

33:20 many strange words appear in our field
33:23 

33:23 other people will be like what does coat
33:25 

33:25 smell like what does robust mean like
33:28 

33:28 what what is cod cleaning so yeah I
33:30 

33:30 think that might Dem a few of those in
33:34 

33:34 this yeah so I I think this has been
33:37 

33:37 like a really good it was supposed to be
33:38 

33:38 about you and your journey but I
33:39 

33:39 realized like because you have such a
33:41 

33:41 wealth of experience we ended up like
33:42 

33:42 delving into like bit technical yeah
33:45 

33:45 yeah but at the same time it's really
33:46 

33:46 interesting yeah because um at the end
33:48 

33:48 of the day it also exemplifies you as a
33:51 

33:51 person you love teaching like that is a
33:52 

33:52 core in fact you considered teaching
33:54 

33:54 before you went into like engineering
33:56 

33:56 sod ofish uh in my childhood I I wanted
33:59 

33:59 to be a teacher yes yeah yeah so there
34:01 

34:01 we go so naturally this conversation was
34:04 

34:04 going to come here but uh yeah I think
34:06 

34:06 we're going to wrap this episode up here
34:08 

34:08 because there are so many topics that
34:09 

34:09 could basically be episodes on your own
34:11 

34:11 so um yeah as we end off thank you
34:14 

34:14 everybody for listening to uh this
34:16 

34:16 episode of our podcast and for learning
34:17 

34:17 more about Salone as well as her journey
34:20 

34:20 as a software engineer as well as all
34:21 

34:21 the other technical uh Concepts that we
34:24 

34:24 have glossed over today so if you have
34:26 

34:26 any further comments you know comment
34:28 

34:28 below what other technical Concepts you
34:29 

34:29 would like us to expound on what other
34:31 

34:31 things about Salone you have questions
34:33 

34:33 about that we can kind of like ask and
34:36 

34:36 um yeah as always thank you for tuning
34:38
