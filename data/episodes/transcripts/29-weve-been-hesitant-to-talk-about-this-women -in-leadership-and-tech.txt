00:01 Okay. Okay. One,
00:03 

00:03 two. You're so nervous.
00:07 

00:07 Okay. Okay. One. We're all good. Okay.
00:09 

00:09 Shake it off. Okay. Ready? One, two,
00:12 

00:12 three. Clap.
00:14 

00:14 Hi everyone. Welcome to Rack Tag, the
00:16 

00:16 place for
00:20 

00:20 That's how a robot sounds like a human
00:23 

00:23 who's pretending to be a robot.
00:26 

00:26 [Music]
00:29 

00:29 Welcome to ragTech, the place for
00:31 

00:31 bytes and banter. My name is Victoria. I'm
00:33 

00:33 a solutions engineer. I'm Natasha, a
00:35 

00:35 software engineer. I'm Salon, software
00:37 

00:37 developer. And today we'll be talking
00:40 

00:40 about leadership, uh, female leadership
00:42 

00:42 in general. But because my experience is
00:45 

00:45 more towards tech, so we all are in
00:47 

00:47 tech. I guess there would be a little
00:49 

00:49 bit of tech. Yeah. The reason why I kind
00:52 

00:52 of proposed this topic to you both is
00:55 

00:55 because I'm currently in a kind of a
00:58 

00:58 team lead role for in my company. So I'm
01:02 

01:02 facing a lot of basically questions that
01:05 

01:05 I have about female leadership, I
01:07 

01:07 noticed that uh being a leader uh a
01:11 

01:11 woman leader in general, it's it's very
01:15 

01:15 how do how do I say it's subtle. It's
01:18 

01:18 subtle and difficult. It's a subtly
01:21 

01:21 complex problem.
01:23 

01:23 Sorry, my mind's not like well
01:25 

01:25 organized. All good. Yeah, this is a
01:27 

01:27 very difficult and complex like issue to
01:29 

01:29 talk about and I think a lot of women
01:31 

01:31 also don't dare to really speak a lot
01:33 

01:33 about it for fear of being cancelled.
01:35 

01:35 But I'm glad you brought this topic up
01:37 

01:37 uh to want to talk about it because I
01:39 

01:39 think we're in quite a good position to
01:41 

01:41 chat about it uh quite openly and
01:43 

01:43 honestly. And I I think you are right.
01:45 

01:45 The differences are very subtle. Like in
01:48 

01:48 general, yes, it is mostly equal. Like
01:51 

01:51 when we're talking about uh male and
01:54 

01:54 female leadership, it should be it
01:56 

01:56 should be equal. It should be. But I
01:58 

01:58 think finding the words to describe
01:60 

01:60 these subtle nuances is hard. Um so I
02:03 

02:03 wanted to ask you so far, what are these
02:06 

02:06 subtle nuances you've been feeling? And
02:08 

02:08 you try your best to put it in words.
02:10 

02:10 Okay. Um so first is like how people
02:14 

02:14 assume uh if you're not at a certain age
02:17 

02:17 as a woman that means you're not that
02:20 

02:20 capable. M so I've since I've in this
02:24 

02:24 new job a lot of people like co-workers
02:26 

02:26 especially males one would be like how
02:29 

02:29 old are you like they keep asking my age
02:32 

02:32 just to figure out like why am I in this
02:34 

02:34 position that's above them and yeah
02:38 

02:38 there's been a lot of like I remember
02:40 

02:40 when I first enter like the first three
02:41 

02:41 months I feel I'm being like silently
02:45 

02:45 observed a lot like people are
02:49 

02:49 evaluating me every second every
02:51 

02:51 decision or every words, every behavior
02:54 

02:54 or gesture I make, they would be
02:56 

02:56 silently observing and that would
02:59 

02:59 accumulate to be like a part of my
03:02 

03:02 impression as a leader and sometimes
03:06 

03:06 it's a hit or miss like some people
03:07 

03:07 would would be nice and would like you
03:10 

03:10 know respect me as their leader but some
03:14 

03:14 would it it's very subtle and the thing
03:17 

03:17 is I'm not even sure if I read people
03:20 

03:20 Right. Sometimes, but I can sense like a
03:22 

03:22 little bit of um maybe cuz it's either
03:25 

03:25 age or either gender. I don't know which
03:27 

03:27 one, right? But I or maybe nothing. It's
03:30 

03:30 just them as a person. They just see me
03:33 

03:33 as like, oh, you're not you're not this
03:37 

03:37 person that I want to see as my leader.
03:39 

03:39 Right. Right. So, yeah, I I don't know.
03:41 

03:41 It's it's very hard. That's why I say
03:42 

03:42 it's very complex and that's the best
03:44 

03:44 way I can put it is is people will
03:46 

03:46 assume and Right. I think like first I
03:48 

03:48 want to get the white elephant out of
03:50 

03:50 the room. We are not like extreme
03:52 

03:52 feminists here or whatever. We're just
03:54 

03:54 people who are experiencing these things
03:56 

03:56 in real life and we're trying to find
03:59 

03:59 the words to talk about it but also very
04:01 

04:01 conscientious that we have to be very
04:03 

04:03 tactful and polite but your feelings are
04:06 

04:06 very valid and I want to first say that
04:09 

04:09 this is a very objective u observation
04:11 

04:11 that you feel you're being observed more
04:13 

04:13 that you feel like people seem to judge
04:16 

04:16 you a little bit differently and there's
04:18 

04:18 always like like for myself I also get
04:21 

04:21 judged that way not that I don't think
04:22 

04:22 I'm really like that like young young
04:25 

04:25 but even the appearance of looking young
04:27 

04:27 does like factor in and like that ven
04:29 

04:29 diagram of you say you didn't know if
04:31 

04:31 it's age or like your gender but being a
04:34 

04:34 youngl looking or young woman uh in a
04:37 

04:37 leadership position does affect and I
04:39 

04:39 would like table it down to huristics
04:41 

04:41 and just statistics statistically there
04:43 

04:43 aren't many firstly women in tech it's
04:46 

04:46 just I don't know what the statistic is
04:47 

04:47 but it's probably like 15% or lesser
04:50 

04:50 secondly women in leadership positions
04:52 

04:52 as a whole also much fewer uh than men.
04:55 

04:55 And you put these things together,
04:57 

04:57 people are going to take a second look
04:58 

04:58 and judge when they see a woman on the
05:00 

05:00 table who is supposed to be like a a
05:03 

05:03 woman in tech and a woman in a
05:05 

05:05 leadership position. It's actually the
05:08 

05:08 first judgment always comes as like are
05:10 

05:10 you sure? Because I've never seen that
05:12 

05:12 before. M and I when I first encountered
05:17 

05:17 that like in the past when I used to
05:18 

05:18 enter a room I wouldn't command a a the
05:21 

05:21 same presence as a a male counterpart um
05:24 

05:24 when it came to uh uh my job but uh I
05:28 

05:28 realized like people don't need to judge
05:31 

05:31 so quickly quickly rather it's your
05:34 

05:34 brain sending you the signals that this
05:36 

05:36 isn't like usual and I think what this
05:39 

05:39 tells us is that we need more role
05:41 

05:41 models in um uh when it comes to women
05:44 

05:44 in leadership positions. I mean we are
05:46 

05:46 in a women uh community where we try to
05:49 

05:49 spotlight more of these women um but
05:51 

05:51 even if there are more women in
05:53 

05:53 leadership positions I feel like a lot
05:54 

05:54 of them don't put the spotlight on
05:56 

05:56 themselves to talk about it more to show
05:59 

05:59 people out there that they exist. So
06:02 

06:02 very naturally there is this very quick
06:05 

06:05 first judgment that um oh you're a woman
06:07 

06:07 you're probably not the engineer in the
06:09 

06:09 room. Oh you're probably not the leader
06:10 

06:10 in the room. And then when you are the
06:13 

06:13 questions in your heads start coming
06:15 

06:15 about. So that's one thing I've observed
06:18 

06:18 uh for that. Just want to say again your
06:20 

06:20 feelings are very valid. I felt that
06:22 

06:22 too. But I wanted to like ask Salomony
06:25 

06:25 about your perspective on that. Like for
06:27 

06:27 you not only are you in a more senior
06:30 

06:30 position in your company as an engineer,
06:32 

06:32 you're also actually both of you are the
06:35 

06:35 co-directors but you were um like a
06:38 

06:38 senior director. A more senior
06:39 

06:39 co-irector. Victoria just joined as like
06:41 

06:41 a co-director for women devs. But in
06:45 

06:45 your experience, um, how would you talk
06:49 

06:49 about these subtle differences of being
06:52 

06:52 like a woman in a leadership position
06:55 

06:55 specifically in tech, I guess, since
06:57 

06:57 that's our environment. I mean, I I also
06:59 

06:59 get there are those uh subtle
07:01 

07:01 differences, but I didn't really uh
07:05 

07:05 think too much about the difference. I
07:07 

07:07 just tried to be myself mostly and one
07:11 

07:11 of like the differences that I usually
07:13 

07:13 see is confidence levels just at least
07:16 

07:16 in myself I do in general my confidence
07:19 

07:19 levels are usually lower than usual
07:21 

07:21 people and for example if there's like a
07:24 

07:24 meet of all the uh tech community
07:26 

07:26 directors at a place you would see that
07:29 

07:29 first there would be a few fewer women
07:32 

07:32 already and the women who are there
07:34 

07:34 which is probably me and like my
07:35 

07:35 co-director we'll be a little bit more
07:37 

07:37 lower confidence levels than the others
07:40 

07:40 and the other tech bros out there. Uh
07:44 

07:44 that is the that's the difference and
07:46 

07:46 I'm very aware of that when that happens
07:49 

07:49 that okay usually tech bros are a little
07:52 

07:52 bit more higher confident. I don't know
07:55 

07:55 why but they are in and
07:59 

07:59 um I don't I don't I don't think too
08:02 

08:02 much about it. It is there. It is like
08:04 

08:04 that. It's the reality. It is the
08:06 

08:06 reality and also I I am I am very aware
08:09 

08:09 that I am representing like there are
08:11 

08:11 women out there looking up to me as oh I
08:14 

08:14 would if she can if she can do it I will
08:16 

08:16 I should be able to do it you know those
08:18 

08:18 kind of feelings at least that's what I
08:20 

08:20 have when I see someone out there above
08:22 

08:22 me. Uh so for them I actually do put in
08:27 

08:27 some effort into like you know what I'm
08:29 

08:29 going to be a bit more confident today
08:31 

08:31 because people are watching me and I
08:33 

08:33 would like to be uh I would like and I
08:36 

08:36 don't know if it's right or wrong but I
08:37 

08:37 try to copy my the the tech bros like
08:41 

08:41 I'll try to take their confidence levels
08:43 

08:43 in and like if they're like uh oh yeah I
08:48 

08:48 always get job offers and always do this
08:51 

08:51 I don't lie I usually don't get job
08:53 

08:53 offers offers like LinkedIn my LinkedIn
08:55 

08:55 has has requests coming in but they're
08:57 

08:57 not job offers they are job interviews
09:00 

09:00 but but tech bro would say it as I get
09:02 

09:02 job offers every day you know like so
09:05 

09:05 there are differences I I feel like
09:07 

09:07 women we are a bit more honest maybe I
09:10 

09:10 would call it honesty perhaps it's not
09:12 

09:12 just honesty but just like I we're quite
09:15 

09:15 encultured to be humble to be less
09:18 

09:18 assertive that is a cultural fact that
09:21 

09:21 we can't run away from for a variety of
09:23 

09:23 different reasons that I'll leave the
09:25 

09:25 people who are researching into
09:26 

09:26 sociology and gender things to like talk
09:29 

09:29 about but that is the reality that we
09:30 

09:30 have to face uh that we are faced with
09:33 

09:33 uh because if our as women we are we are
09:37 

09:37 known to be like this level of humility
09:39 

09:39 let's say and then we kind of like have
09:41 

09:41 to push ourselves a bit more to be more
09:43 

09:43 assertive when we are more assertive
09:45 

09:45 than the average uh woman that's when
09:48 

09:48 people start making comments also and
09:50 

09:50 saying like why are you so assertive?
09:52 

09:52 Why are you so aggressive? I've gotten
09:54 

09:54 that comment so many times from my
09:55 

09:55 bosses. But when I think about it and
09:58 

09:58 then I think about another male
09:59 

09:59 counterpart who's doing the same thing,
10:01 

10:01 if not more, I realize like why isn't
10:03 

10:03 that person being judged the same way as
10:06 

10:06 I was just judged? And I realized it's
10:08 

10:08 because like across the board the
10:10 

10:10 average if there's the expectations you
10:13 

10:13 know um it the average is lower for a
10:16 

10:16 woman in terms of like oh we're on
10:18 

10:18 average a little bit less confident than
10:20 

10:20 men a little bit less assertive. So when
10:22 

10:22 a woman in a leadership p position comes
10:24 

10:24 out and is more assertive and it's more
10:28 

10:28 uh uh confident. That's when people like
10:30 

10:30 pass judgment and they use words like
10:33 

10:33 aggressive, they use words like
10:35 

10:35 stubborn.
10:36 

10:36 uh unfortunate reality. I don't really
10:39 

10:39 have like a solution except that I am
10:41 

10:41 optimistic that this um this will level
10:45 

10:45 out over time. But we have to give it
10:47 

10:47 time to level out and equalize as more
10:50 

10:50 of um you know women in leadership
10:52 

10:52 positions and women in tech rise up and
10:55 

10:55 um that that genderometric does change.
10:57 

10:57 But in the meantime, like what you said,
10:59 

10:59 you're all you you feel accountable to
11:02 

11:02 be to represent as a women role model
11:06 

11:06 for the other women who later will look
11:08 

11:08 at you and think about like, hey, I can
11:10 

11:10 be that person, too. And I also hold
11:12 

11:12 that in regard when these kinds of
11:16 

11:16 things, you know, I experience these
11:17 

11:17 things. I think about it again like,
11:19 

11:19 okay, I will tolerate those comments for
11:21 

11:21 now because I know it is an unfortunate
11:23 

11:23 reality that I have to live with. But
11:26 

11:26 for me to like come out and be
11:27 

11:27 confident, I am being a role model for
11:31 

11:31 the next generation of women or just
11:33 

11:33 like somebody slightly younger than me
11:35 

11:35 who uh will feel like hey like if she
11:38 

11:38 can do it then I can do it too. Then
11:40 

11:40 over time we can level out that I don't
11:42 

11:42 want to call it imbalance. It sounds
11:43 

11:43 like a bad thing but just that natural
11:44 

11:44 imbalance that we have right now. I I
11:47 

11:47 like it. I want to say that I like how
11:48 

11:48 Sloan likes to do this kind of I don't
11:51 

11:51 know what's the right word like
11:52 

11:52 manifestation. Manifestation. you learn
11:54 

11:54 to manifest those energies like she can
11:56 

11:56 she's able to you know self assure
11:59 

11:59 herself like she that's why I actually
12:01 

12:01 want to ask you like what is your
12:03 

12:03 definition of confidence because I think
12:05 

12:05 you do have inner confidence it's just
12:08 

12:08 more like the way maybe you outwardly
12:10 

12:10 portray it may not match your inner
12:13 

12:13 confidence but I feel like you do have
12:15 

12:15 confidence is is quite high your
12:17 

12:17 self-esteem is quite high that's why
12:19 

12:19 you're able to always give yourself
12:21 

12:21 positive words and self assure yourself
12:23 

12:23 that's like the signal that you believe
12:25 

12:25 in yourself, you have high confidence. I
12:27 

12:27 think our confidence is more of like a
12:29 

12:29 matching the the male counterparts
12:32 

12:32 around me like a very because I' I've
12:34 

12:34 seen them I've never seen or hardly ever
12:37 

12:37 seen a not
12:39 

12:39 confident tech bro so I would say just a
12:44 

12:44 blanket assumption all of them are are
12:46 

12:46 pretty confident then just matching
12:48 

12:48 their confidence level would make me
12:50 

12:50 confident. you're you're making them
12:51 

12:51 role models essentially in that sense if
12:54 

12:54 you think about it. I'm not a very good
12:55 

12:55 role model. I mean I'm very aware that
12:57 

12:57 uh some of some of the confidence should
12:60 

12:60 not some of them should not be as
13:01 

13:01 confident as they are cuz
13:04 

13:04 like I said the example right like don't
13:06 

13:06 lie on things like you don't you're not
13:08 

13:08 getting job offers you are getting job
13:12 

13:12 requests requests like uh things like
13:15 

13:15 that.
13:16 

13:16 So maybe it's overconfidence at some
13:18 

13:18 level but even matching it closely like
13:21 

13:21 for example not hesitating when asked a
13:23 

13:23 question or uh being ready and like the
13:27 

13:27 the the mannerisms are you know shows
13:31 

13:31 that I'm confident those kind of things
13:34 

13:34 like cues yeah okay standing confidently
13:38 

13:38 and things like that also I think in the
13:40 

13:40 absence of that true confidence which is
13:44 

13:44 very normal because you don't see other
13:46 

13:46 people like yourself, right? I think
13:48 

13:48 like this strategy of like emulating the
13:50 

13:50 whole like what if I were a man? What
13:52 

13:52 would I say? What would I do? It's an
13:54 

13:54 easy way to come to to kind of like like
13:57 

13:57 uh act it act that confidence out until
13:59 

13:59 you can live up to it. But also I've
14:01 

14:01 also fallen into the trap like one of my
14:04 

14:04 friends she actually highlighted to me
14:06 

14:06 when I said this to like oh I try to act
14:07 

14:07 like a man at my work for example. Like
14:11 

14:11 when I say act like a man, I mean uh
14:14 

14:14 remove my emotions from things, be very
14:17 

14:17 objective and like have no like feelings
14:21 

14:21 for example. So and that was working out
14:24 

14:24 for me until when I when I explained
14:25 

14:25 this to my friend, she was like, "But
14:27 

14:27 Sony, why would you act like a man, but
14:29 

14:29 you are a woman? You're losing that
14:31 

14:31 aspect of yourself that makes you a
14:33 

14:33 woman." And then I was like, "True, I
14:36 

14:36 was trying to be someone I wasn't." M so
14:39 

14:39 so now I'm very aware like I take the
14:41 

14:41 good parts of what I like in in like the
14:44 

14:44 male characteristics but I keep my
14:46 

14:46 emotions my feelings around cuz that
14:50 

14:50 actually helps me in a lot of ways as
14:51 

14:51 well. Mhm. Yeah. And there's nothing
14:53 

14:53 wrong with emotions like even I so I
14:56 

14:56 read a book because I was looking for
14:58 

14:58 answers.
14:59 

14:59 Indra Newui My Life in Full. I don't
15:02 

15:02 know. Uh so she was the Pepsi. Pepsi.
15:05 

15:05 Yeah. Coorder. Yeah. CEO. So she was the
15:08 

15:08 CEO of Pepsi. And basically she say that
15:11 

15:11 there's nothing wrong with leading with
15:12 

15:12 empathy. It's it's something that only
15:15 

15:15 woman leaders can do. So like what you
15:18 

15:18 mentioned, don't subtract it out of who
15:20 

15:20 you are. If you are naturally an
15:22 

15:22 empathetic person then you'll be an
15:24 

15:24 empathetic leader and it's okay like
15:26 

15:26 there's strength to everything. There's
15:28 

15:28 unique strengths to different leadership
15:30 

15:30 styles. So overall my whole experience
15:33 

15:33 on this so far is I I slowly come to my
15:36 

15:36 own conclusion that there must be a
15:38 

15:38 balance between assertiveness,
15:40 

15:40 agreeableness and empathy. M it's like
15:43 

15:43 in general if I'm not in a leadership
15:46 

15:46 position I'm I don't really like speak
15:50 

15:50 up or anything like I'm quite introvert
15:54 

15:54 I know all three of us have to not maybe
15:56 

15:56 not you but the two of us have to go
15:58 

15:58 back into our No it's me too like I
16:01 

16:01 think you guys have this like view that
16:03 

16:03 I've been born like this I think it's
16:04 

16:04 not it's like my natural environment
16:06 

16:06 that I I've realized that in order to
16:09 

16:09 achieve like what I want to achieve I
16:11 

16:11 have to like come out of the show. Yeah.
16:13 

16:13 Yeah. I I am like quite like an
16:15 

16:15 introverty like person at home. All
16:18 

16:18 three of us will actually go back to our
16:19 

16:19 shows after this. Yeah. It's just that
16:21 

16:21 like very early on I was kind of like
16:22 

16:22 forced to face the reality that I was
16:24 

16:24 often the only woman in the room uh for
16:27 

16:27 a variety of factors like my industry
16:29 

16:29 and then like my vocation and then also
16:32 

16:32 like the things I do in general just
16:34 

16:34 lands me in this uh position where I'm
16:36 

16:36 the only person that looks like me kind
16:39 

16:39 of thing. Um but yeah, I think all in
16:42 

16:42 all, like um because this episode is
16:44 

16:44 coming to an end, I I just want to um
16:46 

16:46 clarify to our audience, we might not
16:48 

16:48 have a lot of the right words to use to
16:50 

16:50 describe our experiences and a lot of
16:51 

16:51 things that we say might not sound very
16:53 

16:53 quote unquote politically tactful. And
16:55 

16:55 I'm also concerned that we might be
16:57 

16:57 cancelled and that's why a lot of women
16:59 

16:59 um try not to vocalize the experiences.
17:01 

17:01 But I hope you will give us the empathy
17:03 

17:03 and kindness for us as we delve into
17:06 

17:06 these harder topics um as we try to find
17:09 

17:09 words to process these experiences. And
17:12 

17:12 also to a lot of our wonderful male
17:14 

17:14 viewers out there, just know we're not
17:16 

17:16 we're not bashing you at all. Like um we
17:19 

17:19 are here understanding that the reality
17:21 

17:21 is that we work in an industry where um
17:24 

17:24 the gender numbers are just slightly
17:26 

17:26 imbalanced. Not slightly imbalanced,
17:28 

17:28 it's just a reality. And we're trying to
17:30 

17:30 find ways to firstly emulate a lot of
17:33 

17:33 like salon said good characteristics
17:34 

17:34 that um uh that men in our workplace
17:38 

17:38 like uh showcase but we're also trying
17:40 

17:40 very hard not to let that subtract from
17:42 

17:42 ourselves like Victoria mentioned and
17:44 

17:44 finding this balance is very hard uh and
17:47 

17:47 we're also very aware that not all men
17:49 

17:49 are confident not all men like uh uh
17:51 

17:51 like love public speaking and stuff like
17:53 

17:53 that. We know there are men out there
17:54 

17:54 who also struggle with uh esteem issues,
17:57 

17:57 confidence issues. If anything, I think
17:59 

17:59 we're more asking for tips, advice, um
18:03 

18:03 answers, maybe perspectives,
18:04 

18:04 perspectives. Um and I'm looking forward
18:06 

18:06 to actually do more episodes like this.
18:08 

18:08 I think we've been hesitant to do so
18:10 

18:10 because it is a very tricky topic to
18:11 

18:11 navigate, but I trust in our audience
18:13 

18:13 that they are compassionate and kind and
18:16 

18:16 know that we are just trying to find the
18:18 

18:18 right words to describe. I would like to
18:21 

18:21 also apologize if if this is really
18:24 

18:24 anyone. It's not offense. It's just what
18:26 

18:26 we feel. We're trying to put things into
18:28 

18:28 words. We might have used very strong
18:30 

18:30 words but it's not what we mean exactly.
18:33 

18:33 Uh do let us know in the comments if
18:35 

18:35 anything if you want to clarify anything
18:37 

18:37 or or something. Yeah. Yeah. And of
18:39 

18:39 course like ladies uh in the audience
18:41 

18:41 out there tell us about your experiences
18:43 

18:43 too. Um, and that will also validate our
18:46 

18:46 experiences indirectly because this is
18:48 

18:48 our little community here. As always,
18:50 

18:50 uh, this was Rack Tag, um, the place for
18:53 

18:53 bites and banter and I guess now for
18:55 

18:55 more vulnerable topics. Um, and as
18:58 

18:58 always, we'll see you in the next
18:60 

18:60 episode. Please remember to like,
