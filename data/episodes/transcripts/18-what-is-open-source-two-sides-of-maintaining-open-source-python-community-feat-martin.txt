00:00 in today's episode on re Tech about
00:03 

00:03 Python and open source community so how
00:05 

00:05 do we explain open source to a non- teie
00:07 

00:07 it basically means uh people write
00:09 

00:09 software code and they put it for free
00:12 

00:12 on the internet so everyone can actually
00:14 

00:14 see every single line of code right now
00:16 

00:16 people will say but isn't that dangerous
00:19 

00:19 like if everyone can see the codes uh
00:22 

00:22 isn't there like hackers are going to
00:24 

00:24 exploit that but actually it's it's the
00:26 

00:26 opposite everybody wants everything for
00:28 

00:28 free right so open source is free yeah
00:30 

00:30 and then there there's this meme I'm
00:32 

00:32 sure you have seen this uh where like
00:36 

00:36 the whole internet stack like all these
00:37 

00:37 blocks oh gosh and then there's this
00:39 

00:39 tiny block and then like the whole
00:41 

00:41 internet rests on the shoulders of this
00:43 

00:43 one guy somewhere in Texas in Al writing
00:47 

00:47 code for the SSH library or whatever
00:50 

00:50 right and what if that guy dies and I
00:52 

00:52 have a feeling that's a little bit of a
00:53 

00:53 problem with Singapore being a very
00:56 

00:56 expensive and competitive place people
00:59 

00:59 just don't have time to
01:02 

01:02 do other stuff outside of work just
01:05 

01:05 everybody is already working super super
01:07 

01:07 hard super long hours and I feel many
01:10 

01:10 companies probably don't see going to
01:13 

01:13 Tech meet meetups as part of the
01:16 

01:16 [Music]
01:18 

01:18 work hello everybody we are R Tech uh
01:22 

01:22 this is the place where you hear us uh
01:23 

01:23 go about about bites and benter today we
01:26 

01:26 have myself Natasha I'm a software
01:29 

01:29 engineer and I'm Salon software engineer
01:32 

01:32 and today we have our guest speaker
01:34 

01:34 Martin and Martin is would you like to
01:37 

01:37 uh introduce yourself a retired software
01:40 

01:40 engineer yes a retired software engineer
01:42 

01:42 recently retired a very recently retired
01:45 

01:45 software engineer and today's episode
01:47 

01:47 will be about his uh engineering journey
01:51 

01:51 and his contributions to the python
01:54 

01:54 Community uh and yeah let's let's Dive
01:56 

01:56 Right In yeah first of all uh we wanted
01:59 

01:59 to start off with like a soft
02:01 

02:01 introduction of yourself how you would
02:03 

02:03 introduce yourself to uh uh both techies
02:05 

02:05 and non- techies alike so how would you
02:07 

02:07 introduce yourself
02:09 

02:09 Martin um right now especially since
02:13 

02:13 you're recently retired yes um how would
02:16 

02:16 I introduce myself so normally when I
02:18 

02:18 when I speak at conferences or so I
02:20 

02:20 would say that I'm the CTO I was the CTO
02:24 

02:24 of the artling it's a local startup that
02:27 

02:27 uh deals with Contemporary Art um so
02:31 

02:31 um at the S side of doing that I was
02:34 

02:34 also the organizer of the Python User
02:36 

02:36 Group the monthly Meetup so uh when you
02:39 

02:39 go to meal.com and you look for the Pyon
02:40 

02:40 User Group um then you will find our
02:43 

02:43 group over 6,000 members I think and um
02:47 

02:47 yeah during Co it's fell asleep for
02:49 

02:49 quite a while but recently this year we
02:52 

02:52 have uh we have managed to do a few more
02:54 

02:54 meetups again and I have also been
02:57 

02:57 organizing the Pyon conference in
02:59 

02:59 Singapore
03:00 

03:00 six years in a row but once again thanks
03:03 

03:03 to co that fell asleep so hopefully next
03:06 

03:06 year we can organize a Pon and sing aort
03:08 

03:08 again um yeah so for for techies that's
03:12 

03:12 what I do I I build websites with Pyon
03:15 

03:15 and jeno and react on the front end M
03:18 

03:18 and um yeah in my spare time I
03:22 

03:22 organize Pyon conferences and Pyon
03:24 

03:24 meetups and now that I have a daughter
03:28 

03:28 um I will am bark on a journey to do
03:31 

03:31 homeschooling so that will be my new
03:33 

03:33 full-time job so to speak and uh I'm
03:35 

03:35 quite scared about that you're quite
03:37 

03:37 scared about it that's wonderful
03:39 

03:39 honestly I think it's really hard to
03:40 

03:40 encapsulate your entire Journey as an
03:43 

03:43 engineer but I think like what uh stood
03:45 

03:45 out to me first when I uh knew that you
03:47 

03:47 were coming uh to be a guest on our uh
03:49 

03:49 podcast was uh your involvement in the
03:52 

03:52 python Community um because like with
03:54 

03:54 Salone and I are in a uh kind of uh
03:56 

03:56 sister Tech Community called women devs
03:59 

03:59 SG uh and and uh definitely you know we
04:02 

04:02 relate to a lot of the experiences that
04:03 

04:03 you've had but you've had way more
04:04 

04:04 experience than both of us but uh I
04:07 

04:07 wanted to speak more about python as a
04:10 

04:10 language because for techies and non-
04:12 

04:12 teis alike I think most people would
04:14 

04:14 have heard of this language especially
04:16 

04:16 with the uh birth of uh Ai and ml in
04:19 

04:19 today's uh time and age that uh it's
04:21 

04:21 kind of difficult to get away not
04:22 

04:22 knowing what this language is and I
04:24 

04:24 think most schools and universities
04:26 

04:26 actually teach it now it tends to be a
04:28 

04:28 very entrylevel uh language as well but
04:31 

04:31 uh what a lot of people don't know is
04:33 

04:33 the open-source nature of uh python as a
04:36 

04:36 language that makes it a little bit
04:38 

04:38 different from other commonly used
04:40 

04:40 languages in the tech world so I wanted
04:42 

04:42 to uh pick your brain about what you
04:45 

04:45 feel about uh open source how you would
04:47 

04:47 describe open source to somebody who
04:49 

04:49 hasn't uh uh known it at all and how it
04:52 

04:52 fits in the world of python okay um I
04:55 

04:55 can't even believe that anyone hasn't
04:57 

04:57 heard about open source right if you if
04:59 

04:59 you hang out with leaks all your life
05:01 

05:01 your professional life obviously
05:03 

05:03 everybody knows about open source right
05:05 

05:05 um okay so so how do we explain open
05:07 

05:07 source to a non techy it basically means
05:10 

05:10 uh people write software code and they
05:12 

05:12 put it for free on the internet so
05:15 

05:15 everyone can actually see every single
05:16 

05:16 line of code right so on the other side
05:19 

05:19 we would have closed Source you buy
05:21 

05:21 something uh some piece of software from
05:23 

05:23 a company and you just have an
05:25 

05:25 executable file you can double click the
05:26 

05:26 file and run it but you can't see inside
05:28 

05:28 the file so you don't know what act what
05:30 

05:30 code is behind that file so that will be
05:32 

05:32 closed source and open source you can
05:34 

05:34 see everything so now people will say
05:37 

05:37 but isn't that dangerous like if
05:39 

05:39 everyone can see the codes uh isn't
05:42 

05:42 there like hackers are going to exploit
05:43 

05:43 that but actually it's it's the opposite
05:46 

05:46 the closed source code is the dangerous
05:48 

05:48 one because if there's a bug in the
05:49 

05:49 close closed source code you will never
05:51 

05:51 find out until it's too late but with
05:53 

05:53 the open source code if you are using
05:55 

05:55 some kind of piece of software that is
05:58 

05:58 uh has has reached some kind of Main
05:60 

05:60 stream adoption there will be hundreds
06:02 

06:02 of thousands of pairs of eyes looking at
06:04 

06:04 it and looking for problems with that
06:06 

06:06 right and um so that actually and I feel
06:10 

06:10 back 20 years ago when I when I joined
06:13 

06:13 the
06:14 

06:14 workforce I was working at Bay AG for
06:16 

06:16 the finance department they were
06:17 

06:17 actually they were pretty damn
06:19 

06:19 Progressive already but they were using
06:20 

06:20 C closed Source Microsoft and so
06:24 

06:24 whenever I wanted to do something
06:25 

06:25 Innovative and I wanted to do it with
06:27 

06:27 python they wouldn't allow me right
06:29 

06:29 because the large corporation will
06:31 

06:31 always be like oh no no it's too risky
06:34 

06:34 we going to get hacked I feel now it's
06:36 

06:36 actually the opposite now um governments
06:39 

06:39 corporations are embracing open source
06:41 

06:41 because they they know that it's um
06:43 

06:43 actually safer than closed
06:45 

06:45 source and also um if anything is wrong
06:48 

06:48 if anything goes wrong so back in my
06:50 

06:50 days at Bea with C if anything doesn't
06:53 

06:53 work I'm done I can't do anything right
06:56 

06:56 I would have to file a ticket with the
06:57 

06:57 company that we bought the software from
06:59 

06:59 and hopefully
07:00 

07:00 a skilled individual is going to reply
07:03 

07:03 me not with with the python I can just
07:06 

07:06 step into the code step into the code
07:08 

07:08 and then I end up in the code that I
07:10 

07:10 haven't written myself but that's part
07:11 

07:11 of the framework that I'm using and then
07:13 

07:13 I see why it crashes and then I can
07:15 

07:15 understand what's wrong and I can either
07:18 

07:18 immediately fix the original bug by
07:20 

07:20 submitting a patch but of course that
07:21 

07:21 will usually take a lot of time before
07:23 

07:23 it really uh is then downloadable for
07:25 

07:25 everybody or I can just fix it for
07:27 

07:27 myself on my own local version with
07:29 

07:29 within my project and at least I can
07:31 

07:31 move on right and yeah so it it
07:34 

07:34 supercharges your productivity because
07:36 

07:36 whenever you get stuck it's not the end
07:37 

07:37 of the day you can trace down the error
07:40 

07:40 all the way to the bottom and then you
07:41 

07:41 know what's wrong and then either you
07:43 

07:43 fix it or you you build a work around
07:46 

07:46 and you just know okay my software has
07:48 

07:48 some kind of buck but I know why and
07:50 

07:50 when it happens so then my own code
07:52 

07:52 somehow has to work around that and I
07:54 

07:54 can still at least move forward yeah
07:57 

07:57 yeah there's no back and forth between
07:58 

07:58 like the the person asking you so what
08:00 

08:00 exactly what's your OS what's your this
08:02 

08:02 what's that you know like the in and out
08:05 

08:05 so that's the benefit there and
08:07 

08:07 obviously like with the idea of Open
08:09 

08:09 Source uh it comes very closely with the
08:11 

08:11 idea of community correct because you
08:13 

08:13 know it's a language built by the
08:14 

08:14 community uh for free yeah so uh I think
08:17 

08:17 that would be a huge reason as to why
08:19 

08:19 you're so heavily involved in the python
08:20 

08:20 Community specifically here in Singapore
08:22 

08:22 for now uh could you talk more about
08:24 

08:24 your involvement in that area that also
08:26 

08:26 has two sides of the coin right when you
08:29 

08:29 first get into the open Source community
08:30 

08:30 and when I came to Singapore I was free
08:34 

08:34 to do whatever I want right I needed to
08:36 

08:36 find my footing here somehow so I
08:38 

08:38 started uh a meetup group for
08:40 

08:40 entrepreneurs just so that people get to
08:42 

08:42 know me and I get some customers from my
08:44 

08:44 own web agency and um and then I joined
08:47 

08:47 the first P conference here in Singapore
08:49 

08:49 and I saw this open source spirit all
08:51 

08:51 these people just freely sharing their
08:54 

08:54 knowledge and and you know showing what
08:56 

08:56 libraries they have built and and how
08:57 

08:57 you can use them all for free and then
08:60 

08:60 you get to see those people as well you
09:01 

09:01 get you get to have a beer with them and
09:03 

09:03 it's it's incredible like some of these
09:05 

09:05 people are extremely well-known
09:07 

09:07 Engineers from the US who fly in for the
09:09 

09:09 conference right and suddenly they are
09:11 

09:11 so tangible you can shake their hands
09:13 

09:13 can talk to them and you just share all
09:15 

09:15 the knowledge with you freely right um
09:18 

09:18 and so this sense of community is
09:20 

09:20 incredibly motivating for for you then
09:23 

09:23 to think okay maybe I should also write
09:25 

09:25 a little library and then who knows
09:27 

09:27 maybe on GitHub somebody will start it
09:29 

09:29 will start using it and that's what I
09:31 

09:31 did right and in my company um we use
09:33 

09:33 Jango as the web framework and Jango has
09:36 

09:36 this thing called reusable apps so you
09:38 

09:38 can write your code in such a way that
09:40 

09:40 it's generic so that anyone can plug in
09:42 

09:42 that app into their uh project and then
09:45 

09:45 also use that so instead of building a
09:47 

09:47 calendar um software just for ourselves
09:50 

09:50 we build it as a reusable app our
09:53 

09:53 clients to pay us to do that of course
09:55 

09:55 but then the next client who also needs
09:56 

09:56 a calendar then we don't need to code
09:58 

09:58 anything we just plug that into that
09:59 

09:59 project as well right and then it turns
10:02 

10:02 like after a while we got relatively
10:05 

10:05 well known worldwide that this agency
10:07 

10:07 does all these Jango packages and so
10:09 

10:09 then other people that I don't even know
10:11 

10:11 where they are and who they are they
10:13 

10:13 started looking into our code as well
10:16 

10:16 and I mean most of the time they make
10:18 

10:18 requests they want something from you
10:20 

10:20 they hope that you build it for them
10:21 

10:21 right but then we are just like oh we
10:23 

10:23 always reply if you want to have it you
10:25 

10:25 can submit a patch and we will merge it
10:27 

10:27 right so and sometimes they do so then
10:29 

10:29 our our packages actually got better and
10:31 

10:31 we didn't even have to quote anything
10:33 

10:33 other people were were committing work
10:35 

10:35 for us so to speak right um so that's
10:38 

10:38 incredibly motivating but there's the
10:40 

10:40 flip side everybody wants everything for
10:42 

10:42 free right so open source is free and
10:45 

10:45 then there there's this meme I'm sure
10:47 

10:47 you have seen this uh where like the
10:50 

10:50 whole internet stacked like all these
10:52 

10:52 blocks and then there's this tiny block
10:54 

10:54 and then like the whole internet rests
10:56 

10:56 on the shoulders of this one guy
10:58 

10:58 somewhere in Texas
11:01 

11:01 writing code for the SSH library or
11:03 

11:03 whatever right and what if that guy dies
11:06 

11:06 and nobody takes over that library then
11:07 

11:07 the whole internet will yes we will put
11:09 

11:09 that Meme on like a video it's a really
11:11 

11:11 funny one and um I felt that burnout
11:14 

11:14 myself right so at some point we didn't
11:16 

11:16 do that much work with those Jango
11:18 

11:18 libraries anymore but all these requests
11:21 

11:21 the pull requests and issues were still
11:23 

11:23 coming in right and then I was already
11:25 

11:25 working on artling where I was doing
11:27 

11:27 Less open source and and still had all
11:30 

11:30 this Legacy sitting there in my GitHub
11:32 

11:32 account I have like I don't know like 80
11:34 

11:34 80 repositories or something um and at
11:38 

11:38 some point you have to just say no and
11:41 

11:41 and you will just say I'm no longer
11:43 

11:43 maintaining this why I have actually
11:45 

11:45 when whenever anyone wants something
11:47 

11:47 from one of my old um repositories I I
11:50 

11:50 offer to them that they become
11:51 

11:51 maintainer and then I just move it over
11:53 

11:53 to them yeah and that works as well most
11:55 

11:55 of the time people are happy to take it
11:56 

11:56 over um but yeah so um it's cool that
11:60 

11:60 it's motivating but it can also burn you
12:02 

12:02 out so you have to balance it like
12:03 

12:03 everything in life yeah this is a really
12:06 

12:06 interesting perspective to maintaining
12:08 

12:08 open source that I think people don't
12:09 

12:09 see this um I mean it's not so much of a
12:11 

12:11 bad side it's just a realistic side of
12:13 

12:13 maintaining uh open source libraries
12:15 

12:15 projects and stuff like that also for uh
12:17 

12:17 the audience members who don't really
12:19 

12:19 know the process behind open source when
12:21 

12:21 we talk about patches when we talk about
12:23 

12:23 merges uh basically when a uh open-
12:26 

12:26 source project is basically
12:28 

12:28 contributable by anybody in Community
12:30 

12:30 you usually would need a maintainer sort
12:32 

12:32 of like a moderator of a Reddit Forum
12:35 

12:35 kind of person uh who usually is the
12:37 

12:37 owner of like owner or founder of like
12:40 

12:40 that project when requests to change uh
12:43 

12:43 the project come in you will have to
12:45 

12:45 have somebody to review it and check
12:47 

12:47 that it works well with the rest of the
12:48 

12:48 code and then merge it in but what
12:50 

12:50 Martin is saying is that this can be
12:52 

12:52 quite texting over time especially you
12:54 

12:54 know you also have a separate group of
12:56 

12:56 people who uh are only raising issues
12:59 

12:59 and are putting in quod to actually
13:01 

13:01 change it so when he talks about that
13:03 

13:03 Legacy that backlog of issues you
13:05 

13:05 basically have this project with like 80
13:07 

13:07 over and sometimes 100 even a thousand
13:09 

13:09 like hey change this change that and
13:11 

13:11 he's like what do I do I have to like
13:13 

13:13 review everything so I yeah now that you
13:17 

13:17 uh mention it it is really uh difficult
13:20 

13:20 to kind of uh maintain that but I like
13:22 

13:22 the idea of like getting somebody else
13:24 

13:24 to be a maintainer I think it takes a
13:26 

13:26 lot of like uh your yourself and putting
13:29 

13:29 your I have to say OS aside to give up
13:32 

13:32 that project to somebody else knowing
13:33 

13:33 that you're burning out and there's more
13:35 

13:35 spaces that you can contribute to yeah
13:37 

13:37 and that's really admirable uh by itself
13:41 

13:41 when when we bring it back to Pyon a
13:42 

13:42 little bit what you say this maintainer
13:44 

13:44 or moderator in the Pyon Community this
13:46 

13:46 this was g f rosum the guy who invented
13:48 

13:48 pison right and uh this the bdfl right
13:51 

13:51 the benan dictator for life right so
13:54 

13:54 like that's like actually open source is
13:56 

13:56 also like
13:57 

13:57 decentralized random people in world
13:60 

13:60 doing stuff but also very centralized
14:02 

14:02 one single person usually has the commit
14:04 

14:04 R to the repository who can then merge
14:07 

14:07 all these contributions right so yeah so
14:11 

14:11 that's like this Duality right many many
14:14 

14:14 people but still one person has to be
14:16 

14:16 the the the the final moderator or like
14:19 

14:19 Linux linos tows is notorious for uh for
14:23 

14:23 hurting people's feelings when they
14:24 

14:24 submit code and then he says this is
14:26 

14:26  I will never accept this code but I
14:30 

14:30 mean Linux is good right yes that's why
14:32 

14:32 it's good you have like that one guy
14:34 

14:34 who's just like gatekeeping maybe
14:36 

14:36 another aspect that we should point out
14:38 

14:38 about open source is um The Learning
14:40 

14:40 aspect right by having all this code
14:42 

14:42 open source um I can learn from any
14:46 

14:46 repository right I want to build
14:48 

14:48 something there is something that's
14:50 

14:50 already similar to what I want to do I
14:52 

14:52 just look at the code I see how how they
14:54 

14:54 have done it and by that you pick up
14:57 

14:57 programming patterns right um that
14:60 

14:60 that's um very very valuable so yes
15:03 

15:03 definitely I mean when I came to
15:05 

15:05 Singapore and started my own company
15:07 

15:07 there was no guru that I can ask in my
15:10 

15:10 in my company before there was that Guru
15:13 

15:13 that knew everything about everything
15:15 

15:15 and whenever I got stuck I would ask him
15:17 

15:17 right and by the way that guy had a
15:21 

15:21 private chat with Gan Russell so I kind
15:24 

15:24 of learned Pyon from somebody who
15:27 

15:27 learned Pyon from the source
15:30 

15:30 so that's that's the reason why he knew
15:32 

15:32 everything about everything
15:34 

15:34 right when I ask a very difficult
15:37 

15:37 question then he would be like oh let me
15:38 

15:38 just ask youo there different time zones
15:40 

15:40 it would take a while but it's still
15:42 

15:42 amaz yeah I guess I was very lucky to be
15:45 

15:45 at the right time at the right Point
15:48 

15:48 like in a totally unknown tiny company
15:50 

15:50 in Germany where this dude somehow is a
15:53 

15:53 friend of G so crazy um but yeah um The
15:56 

15:56 Learning aspect is incredible right so I
15:58 

15:58 came to sing up don't have my Guru
15:60 

15:60 anymore but so when I get stuck you
16:02 

16:02 first panic right oh my God I will never
16:05 

16:05 be able to fix this how am I my my
16:07 

16:07 customer is um expecting me to to ship
16:11 

16:11 this software but seem as a seemingly
16:14 

16:14 impossible uh problem that I can't solve
16:17 

16:17 well first of all you should go to sleep
16:18 

16:18 the next morning usually all these
16:19 

16:19 problems are gone right yeah but if the
16:21 

16:21 next morning is still difficult then you
16:23 

16:23 can go around and look at other open
16:25 

16:25 source projects and see how other people
16:26 

16:26 have solved the same problem yeah yeah
16:28 

16:28 definitely I think a learning aspect is
16:29 

16:29 important I really love what you said
16:31 

16:31 about gurus and you know you were lucky
16:33 

16:33 at that point of time that you happen to
16:35 

16:35 be right space right time and space to
16:37 

16:37 meet them but I think especially with
16:38 

16:38 all of us you know being in Tech
16:40 

16:40 communities and we're really trying to
16:41 

16:41 find these gurus and put them in one
16:43 

16:43 place through conferences and stuff like
16:44 

16:44 that I think Salone can talk more about
16:45 

16:45 this especially as a co-director of
16:47 

16:47 women devs both of you can relate to how
16:49 

16:49 difficult it is to find speakers am I
16:51 

16:51 right like so I'm sure you can relate to
16:54 

16:54 that and the difficulty of that but uh
16:56 

16:56 being able to put these people in the
16:58 

16:58 same place I I think that's the magic of
17:01 

17:01 tech communities like uh the python user
17:03 

17:03 group like our women dev's SG we put
17:06 

17:06 this gurus together so everybody can
17:07 

17:07 learn from them uh so you don't have to
17:09 

17:09 be a right time and space um as we had
17:12 

17:12 to do like I guess that's the point of
17:14 

17:14 conferences right yeah yeah yeah and
17:16 

17:16 that's why would you still be like
17:17 

17:17 actively involved in Pyon then like now
17:20 

17:20 that you're re well I can well my
17:24 

17:24 daughter is 3 months old now right I
17:26 

17:26 didn't have a single second for myself
17:28 

17:28 so I don't
17:30 

17:30 know how I could possibly organize
17:32 

17:32 another Pyon um knowing how how hard
17:35 

17:35 that is as well right that's not easy to
17:37 

17:37 do that and especially in Singapore it's
17:41 

17:41 quite difficult to find good venues
17:43 

17:43 there's always a lot of money involved
17:44 

17:44 and when there's money involved and
17:46 

17:46 there is expectations involved and so on
17:48 

17:48 and um luckily the Pyon Community is
17:51 

17:51 very laidback and very grass rots so um
17:55 

17:55 you can just you know go to a school get
17:57 

17:57 like some school rooms and people will
17:59 

17:59 be and have a have a good time at the
18:01 

18:01 conference but over the years we have
18:03 

18:03 raised the bar a little bit for p
18:04 

18:04 conference so um I guess if we wanted to
18:07 

18:07 do another one it has to be better than
18:09 

18:09 the previous one right and so then you
18:11 

18:11 have to find um um sponsors right you
18:15 

18:15 have to go to corporates and and do
18:17 

18:17 sponsorships and so on just so that you
18:19 

18:19 can get a good venue and yeah it's it's
18:22 

18:22 going to be tough um I will obviously
18:23 

18:23 focus on my on my daughter um so my main
18:27 

18:27 goal in the Pyon Community right now is
18:29 

18:29 to find somebody to replace me or or you
18:31 

18:31 know like so at least I can delegate a
18:33 

18:33 little bit the problem with the pon user
18:35 

18:35 group is it's a huge Community 6,000
18:38 

18:38 people everybody loves to come to the
18:39 

18:39 meetups get free pizza come to the
18:42 

18:42 conference but nobody wants to do
18:44 

18:44 anything right it's so difficult to find
18:47 

18:47 we've been for years at the AGM so um
18:50 

18:50 the Pyon user group is actually a
18:52 

18:52 registered Society in Singapore and we
18:54 

18:54 have to do an AGM every year which we
18:56 

18:56 often miss as well but every year we
18:58 

18:58 like okay next year we will focus on
19:00 

19:00 finding replacements for us and grooming
19:02 

19:02 a new generation of of volunteers for
19:05 

19:05 the for the society but it never happens
19:08 

19:08 every year like 10 people are like yeah
19:10 

19:10 I want to volunteer we we put them in
19:12 

19:12 our slack and then they never say
19:14 

19:14 anything and then they just all
19:16 

19:16 disappear and then it's just us again
19:18 

19:18 right so oh it's so hard it's so hard to
19:20 

19:20 find uh we can relate to that cuz we
19:22 

19:22 also have like basically I I was also in
19:26 

19:26 awe a little of you that you are
19:28 

19:28 attacking your yourself but because
19:30 

19:30 you're passionate about python open
19:33 

19:33 source you would put in this effort to
19:35 

19:35 like bring this out to everyone else let
19:37 

19:37 you know form a community find speakers
19:40 

19:40 find venues host these conferences these
19:43 

19:43 events and that's what we are doing as
19:45 

19:45 well uh and it there's so much effort
19:49 

19:49 that goes through there and yeah it's
19:51 

19:51 just it's just difficult and the problem
19:54 

19:54 is the longer you do this the better
19:58 

19:58 your network is and the EAS is for me
20:01 

20:01 for me organizing a meet up is easy
20:04 

20:04 because I know 10 people with great
20:05 

20:05 venues and they know me and they just
20:07 

20:07 invite me I know all the speakers they I
20:09 

20:09 know everybody's program in Singapore
20:11 

20:11 probably right and anyone else probably
20:14 

20:14 is afraid of the workload and I would
20:16 

20:16 have to admit yeah if you start from
20:19 

20:19 scratch it's a little bit of work it's
20:21 

20:21 for me I can say it's easy but it's
20:23 

20:23 actually not that easy but of course I
20:26 

20:26 mean every time we ask people to come
20:28 

20:28 and help us I will still be there in the
20:30 

20:30 background right and still provide all
20:32 

20:32 the the networking and information
20:34 

20:34 correct yeah you your network still goes
20:36 

20:36 on to the next I have a feeling that's a
20:38 

20:38 little bit of a problem with Singapore
20:41 

20:41 being a very expensive and competitive
20:43 

20:43 place people just don't have time to
20:47 

20:47 do other stuff outside of work exactly
20:50 

20:50 just everybody is already working super
20:53 

20:53 super hard super long hours especially
20:56 

20:56 now with this like Tech layoffs
20:59 

20:59 happening I think each engineer has to
21:01 

21:01 work extra hard to prove themselves in
21:04 

21:04 their workplace and you know never know
21:06 

21:06 what's going to happen yeah and and I
21:08 

21:08 feel many companies probably don't see
21:11 

21:11 going to Tech meet meetups as part of
21:13 

21:13 the work like it should be no problem
21:16 

21:16 that an employee says at 5:00 p.m. by I
21:19 

21:19 will go to the Meetup there should be
21:21 

21:21 nobody raising an eyebrow right because
21:23 

21:23 that still work and actually that
21:25 

21:25 employee will hang out then from 7 to
21:27 

21:27 10: at the meet up that's actually a
21:30 

21:30 long work day for that person right but
21:33 

21:33 I I think many young Engineers are
21:35 

21:35 probably afraid to be the one who who
21:37 

21:37 exits the office first right and so then
21:40 

21:40 they they don't have time to come to the
21:41 

21:41 meet up by 7 by and then we have to push
21:44 

21:44 the meetups later and later which also
21:46 

21:46 makes it hard for people with family now
21:48 

21:48 I can't go and and host a meet up from 8
21:50 

21:50 to 10: because my daughter has supposed
21:53 

21:53 to sleep at eight and I have to help my
21:54 

21:54 wife right
21:56 

21:56 so and now I understand never had
21:59 

21:59 children of course before and so and
22:01 

22:01 most of the crowd probably also didn't
22:03 

22:03 have children I I assume and now that I
22:06 

22:06 have I feel like wow we need to create a
22:08 

22:08 completely different culture in this
22:09 

22:09 country if we want to keep these
22:10 

22:10 communities alive yes exactly I mean
22:13 

22:13 it's not just for the sake of keeping
22:15 

22:15 the communities alive this is a really
22:17 

22:17 important part as we said we bring gurus
22:19 

22:19 together people learn especially how
22:21 

22:21 with how fast-paced our uh industry is
22:24 

22:24 you have to keep learning you have to
22:25 

22:25 keep meeting people um so that you can
22:28 

22:28 continue ly uh grow your SEC and learn
22:31 

22:31 from others and you're right in that a
22:34 

22:34 lot of companies and organizations don't
22:36 

22:36 yet understand that it's part of work
22:38 

22:38 yeah yeah I really like the aspect and I
22:40 

22:40 think I want to start talking about this
22:41 

22:41 more too that it's not a bonus thing
22:44 

22:44 when you leave for work and join this
22:46 

22:46 meet up and that it's part of work like
22:48 

22:48 I say it's now you're extending your
22:49 

22:49 hours to 10 p.m. yeah and uh actually I
22:52 

22:52 get asked this a lot because of like I
22:54 

22:54 don't know if you guys have had it but
22:57 

22:57 uh people have asked me if I'm monetized
22:59 

22:59 for the things that we're doing you know
23:00 

23:00 organizing the meetups or speaking in
23:02 

23:02 panels and conferences but the fact is
23:04 

23:04 that even this podcast even this podcast
23:07 

23:07 never go to yeah it's because we're so
23:10 

23:10 perhaps it's a culture of Open Source
23:11 

23:11 perhaps it's us being a tech industry
23:13 

23:13 and knowing it's just survival for us to
23:16 

23:16 have to like share and learn constantly
23:19 

23:19 that these things come so naturally for
23:20 

23:20 us we're not even like begging for a
23:22 

23:22 single sent here we want to connect with
23:24 

23:24 people and learn so we're here also just
23:26 

23:26 telling everybody like go to be yes go
23:29 

23:29 to meetups because these are things that
23:31 

23:31 are creative without like a single oh
23:35 

23:35 there are meetups that have monetization
23:37 

23:37 aspects but mostly it's to keep the
23:38 

23:38 meetups alive actually more than
23:40 

23:40 anything else these are free events
23:42 

23:42 because we understand the value of
23:43 

23:43 learning in our communities we
23:45 

23:45 understand the uh value of the open
23:47 

23:47 source Community culture um and yeah
23:51 

23:51 please come and companies organizations
23:53 

23:53 even if you're a non- techie yourself uh
23:55 

23:55 we hope you understand this aspect that
23:57 

23:57 is part of our work and it is very hard
23:60 

23:60 work as you can see from what we're
24:02 

24:02 saying here uh we have the co-director
24:04 

24:04 of women devs here and we have like a
24:07 

24:07 Pioneer in like the uh Singapore Pyon
24:09 

24:09 User Group Community here as well it's
24:11 

24:11 very hard to upkeep this these groups
24:13 

24:13 but we thank you for the work uh that
24:15 

24:15 you're doing uh and we're really happy
24:18 

24:18 to still be uh contributing as community
24:20 

24:20 and I'm sure even though at this point
24:22 

24:22 you retire as a that as he said you'll
24:24 

24:24 always be the Emir advisor at the back
24:27 

24:27 end thank you for watching part one of
24:29 

24:29 our chat with Martin where we explored
24:32 

24:32 his take on open source as well as his
24:33 

24:33 contributions to the Tech Community as
24:35
