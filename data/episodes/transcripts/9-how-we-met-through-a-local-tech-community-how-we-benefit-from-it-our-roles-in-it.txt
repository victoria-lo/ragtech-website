00:14 everybody Welcome to re tag the place
00:16 

00:16 where we share byes and Venture my name
00:18 

00:18 is Natasha I'm a software engineer I'm
00:20 

00:20 Salon software developer and I'm
00:22 

00:22 Victoria Solutions engineer and together
00:24 

00:24 we are re tag today's episode will be
00:26 

00:26 all about running a community um three
00:28 

00:28 of us are actually in a common Tech
00:31 

00:31 Community called women of code it's a
00:32 

00:32 global uh Community yep as you can see
00:36 

00:36 yeah and we're in the Singapore chapter
00:38 

00:38 of that Community um it has like it's
00:40 

00:40 over 147 countries all over the world
00:43 

00:43 but uh we are specifically in the
00:44 

00:44 Singapore chapter because we're in
00:46 

00:46 Singapore so uh this episode will be all
00:49 

00:49 about like what it means to be in a
00:51 

00:51 community um maybe our Journeys as to
00:53 

00:53 how we found this community in the first
00:55 

00:55 place especially as people uh in the uh
00:58 

00:58 Tech world and also uh how we run it
01:01 

01:01 because we're uh not only just like U
01:03 

01:03 participating in the activities we're
01:05 

01:05 part of like the organizing um crew as
01:08 

01:08 well so uh to start off maybe we should
01:10 

01:10 introduce our own roles in the community
01:13 

01:13 so um we're going to do a reintro again
01:15 

01:15 I guess uh I'm Natasha but uh I'm one of
01:17 

01:17 like the evangelists in women of code um
01:20 

01:20 we'll explain what an evangelist is
01:22 

01:22 later um but Salone yep I am sonone I
01:26 

01:26 will I'm the director at wom who code uh
01:29 

01:29 we have two directors so I'm the code
01:30 

01:30 director M and I'm Victoria I'm also
01:32 

01:32 evangelist in Womanhood Cod yeah so um
01:36 

01:36 basically um I think our community uh
01:40 

01:40 we're we're we're going to like use our
01:41 

01:41 community as an anecdote but uh this is
01:44 

01:44 not how all communities are run
01:45 

01:45 obviously U we'll be speaking from our
01:47 

01:47 experiences but we just want to like be
01:49 

01:49 able to introduce um our experiences
01:51 

01:51 with common understanding so for in the
01:53 

01:53 first place like a director you want to
01:56 

01:56 explain your role of a director really
01:57 

01:57 quickly yeah so as as the Director of
01:59 

01:59 women so as Natasha explained we are the
02:02 

02:02 Singapore chapter so uh my role as the
02:05 

02:05 Director would be to I I'll just ensure
02:08 

02:08 the Run of events where we try to one
02:11 

02:11 event per month it could be online or in
02:14 

02:14 person the main aim of this commun this
02:16 

02:16 Tech Community is to encourage more
02:19 

02:19 women to remain and Excel in Tech
02:22 

02:22 careers so we'll do uh sessions
02:25 

02:25 workshops around it we'll have uh
02:28 

02:28 different verticals within the community
02:30 

02:30 so like cyber security software
02:32 

02:32 development uh data science data science
02:35 

02:35 AI so there are different verticals
02:37 

02:37 there will be different events for each
02:38 

02:38 of these verticles I'll ensure that is
02:41 

02:41 an event we are abiding by the global uh
02:44 

02:44 rules policies that we have for women
02:46 

02:46 who code and uh any Partnerships or uh
02:50 

02:50 you can say that I'll be the face of the
02:53 

02:53 Singapore chapter so that's how we do it
02:56 

02:56 and evangelist evangelist Victoria so
02:60 

02:60 evangelist is basically like the person
03:02 

03:02 who kind of promotes events on social
03:06 

03:06 media about womenhood code uh for me I
03:09 

03:09 also see evangelist as someone who is
03:11 

03:11 actively participating when organizing
03:14 

03:14 the event so I'm doing both like
03:17 

03:17 organizing the event like handling
03:19 

03:19 Logistics as well if needed to and as
03:22 

03:22 well as social media marketing so in a
03:24 

03:24 way doing all those also I think
03:26 

03:26 evangelists also help out on the day of
03:29 

03:29 the event if they have time they'll go
03:31 

03:31 in and volunteer as well that's why we
03:33 

03:33 have the shirts well except for me there
03:35 

03:35 was a supply chain
03:37 

03:37 disruption she'll get her shirt soon we
03:40 

03:40 hope to see her in her shirt soon uh but
03:42 

03:42 yeah so that is kind of how I see an
03:44 

03:44 evangelist role is someone who can
03:46 

03:46 actually lead the marketing campaigns as
03:49 

03:49 well as like promote and showcase the
03:52 

03:52 voice of womenhood code within those
03:54 

03:54 social media platforms do you have
03:56 

03:56 another persp I mean real quickly I
03:58 

03:58 wanted to like say something funny did
03:59 

03:59 you realized the term evangelist while
04:02 

04:02 it's commonly used in like the tech
04:04 

04:04 industry as a whole it's a very strange
04:05 

04:05 term that's only used in Cults I had
04:08 

04:08 like a non- techie friend like when I
04:10 

04:10 was introducing myself and she was like
04:12 

04:12 are you in a cult and I was like what do
04:13 

04:13 you mean and I realized like yeah to
04:15 

04:15 evangelize you know to spre the word
04:17 

04:17 like I realized like why do we use such
04:19 

04:19 cultish names in a tech industry okay so
04:21 

04:21 you know uh I don't know where the term
04:23 

04:23 I I I it it has a similar connotation
04:26 

04:26 yes but um I don't know why it's in the
04:28 

04:28 tech industry it's a welled term it's
04:30 

04:30 not just for like women who code you
04:32 

04:32 will see that in actual job titles so um
04:36 

04:36 just putting it out there uh but for
04:37 

04:37 evangelist yeah basically what Victoria
04:39 

04:39 says we're just active like voices of
04:42 

04:42 like the community we represent you'll
04:43 

04:43 also see this role in the companies as
04:45 

04:45 well where they're trying to evangelize
04:47 

04:47 and spread the word on their own
04:49 

04:49 products uh so these people are like
04:51 

04:51 sort of the phas and the brand
04:53 

04:53 ambassadors of the company so that's
04:54 

04:54 just kind of like what our role is so um
04:58 

04:58 so like these Tech communities they
04:59 

04:59 actually just uh volunteer groups and
05:02 

05:02 these roles are not uh like fixed like a
05:05 

05:05 job role it is just a term we give to
05:08 

05:08 like different members of the of the
05:11 

05:11 group so that there is a duty to do but
05:13 

05:13 everyone can do everything yeah so we
05:16 

05:16 have uh General volunteers we have
05:18 

05:18 Avengers we have leads uh they have like
05:21 

05:21 specific there are like some ground
05:23 

05:23 rules ground roles Scopes to follow but
05:27 

05:27 everyone is allowed to and to do
05:29 

05:29 anything because it's a volunteer role
05:32 

05:32 uh even for me like no one's paid to do
05:35 

05:35 it so I wanted to ask like why did you
05:38 

05:38 join a Tech
05:40 

05:40 Community yeah I think for myself um I
05:43 

05:43 actually joined women Cod like I'm the
05:45 

05:45 most recent member I would say amongst
05:47 

05:47 three of us I joined like somewhere late
05:48 

05:48 last year um I had like how I got
05:51 

05:51 introduced to women of Co was actually
05:52 

05:52 through a panel that uh women Co was
05:55 

05:55 organizing and I was invited to be one
05:57 

05:57 of panelists by um uh one of our fellow
05:59 

05:59 um um women to quote leads at that point
06:03 

06:03 um and that was how I got introduced to
06:06 

06:06 the Tech Community uh to the idea of
06:08 

06:08 what a Tech Community was in the first
06:10 

06:10 place um I between the panel and
06:13 

06:13 actually joining um I actually put off
06:15 

06:15 really like joining joining because um I
06:17 

06:17 was afraid of the responsibility and I
06:19 

06:19 didn't know if I needed one at a point
06:21 

06:21 but I ended up joining at the point
06:23 

06:23 where I was at a very low point in my
06:25 

06:25 career I was very lost and um Beyond um
06:30 

06:30 you know working for my organization I
06:32 

06:32 started getting kind of like confused as
06:34 

06:34 to why I was in tech in the first place
06:37 

06:37 you know I felt like I didn't have um
06:40 

06:40 like um similar voices around me
06:42 

06:42 different experiences to learn from and
06:44 

06:44 I was in an organization that I was the
06:47 

06:47 only female software engineer um for
06:51 

06:51 like many years um and I realized like
06:54 

06:54 wow I la like having you know women
06:56 

06:56 friends around me who were talking about
06:59 

06:59 uh Tech and being Tech um and I just
07:02 

07:02 realized I felt very alone and um being
07:05 

07:05 in that one panel I realized like wait
07:07 

07:07 actually that was one of the first few
07:08 

07:08 times that I saw that one more more than
07:10 

07:10 one woman you know being in Tech in in
07:13 

07:13 like a an event so I decided to take the
07:17 

07:17 plch and join it um and I was right I
07:20 

07:20 did find a community of very diverse
07:22 

07:22 like uh women and men actually like
07:25 

07:25 obviously even though we're called women
07:27 

07:27 who quote I I don't I don't see a
07:29 

07:29 distinction per se like we are exclusive
07:32 

07:32 to women it's just more of like we want
07:34 

07:34 to uh provide that platform for people
07:37 

07:37 to see that they are they themselves are
07:40 

07:40 represented um to feel encouraged to
07:42 

07:42 reach out to join just like I did you
07:44 

07:44 know when I realized like wait everybody
07:47 

07:47 around me you know uh don't they don't
07:49 

07:49 look like me they have like experiences
07:52 

07:52 even though valuable to learn from are
07:54 

07:54 not the same as what I would and I need
07:56 

07:56 somebody to uh learn from that can share
07:59 

07:59 um similar problems um so that's kind of
08:02 

08:02 like how I ended up joining women of
08:04 

08:04 code um but yeah what about Victoria for
08:07 

08:07 yourself oh yeah I was just like smiling
08:09 

08:09 the whole time cuz I was admiring the
08:11 

08:11 your your journey and how you found
08:13 

08:13 woman code I think that's really nice
08:15 

08:15 and I I'm very glad that you found this
08:17 

08:17 community and we're super also glad that
08:19 

08:19 you know we can be a part of this cuz we
08:21 

08:21 met true woman who C right true so I
08:23 

08:23 just feeling sentimental oh that's true
08:26 

08:26 I just feel like yeah um but yeah for me
08:29 

08:29 um I actually got to know a woman who
08:30 

08:30 Cote from a friend so actually at the
08:33 

08:33 time I was quite active like online
08:35 

08:35 already in the Tech Community like
08:37 

08:37 online tech community so I was looking
08:39 

08:39 for something more offline some like I
08:41 

08:41 can meet people in real life cuz you
08:43 

08:43 know I've always been just existing
08:45 

08:45 online and people know about toline
08:48 

08:48 online avatar yeah like I'm just we're
08:50 

08:50 sounding like the metaverse now yeah
08:52 

08:52 like I'm just this 2D Avatar holding a
08:54 

08:54 cup of tea you know so I I I I liked it
08:57 

08:57 I enjoyed it but I feel like I need to
08:59 

08:59 talk to to people in real life you know
09:01 

09:01 I need to meet people in real life and I
09:03 

09:03 want to feel like my community like I
09:05 

09:05 contribute to my community like directly
09:08 

09:08 so that's why I was looking for a local
09:09 

09:09 community to join and then my friend
09:12 

09:12 invited me she was a lead at Womanhood
09:14 

09:14 code so she invited me to join she's
09:16 

09:16 like how about Womanhood code you know I
09:17 

09:17 think this role would be suitable for
09:19 

09:19 you so I joined without much um
09:23 

09:23 expectation yeah because I thought you
09:24 

09:24 know it's just like you know a small
09:26 

09:26 volunteer role that I can do but what
09:29 

09:29 taught me off guard is that every single
09:32 

09:32 person like we meet for the first time
09:33 

09:33 in like a group setting and every single
09:35 

09:35 person I meet is like so passionate
09:37 

09:37 about like contributing to the community
09:40 

09:40 and sharing that same values as me like
09:41 

09:41 being able to like just join and just
09:43 

09:43 take your time off from like any other
09:46 

09:46 things to volunteer for this to actually
09:48 

09:48 make Community impact building
09:51 

09:51 communities running community events
09:54 

09:54 like we all share that same passion and
09:55 

09:55 I'm like very surprised cuz it's so
09:58 

09:58 different from like in online where like
09:60 

09:60 I'm just talking and I'm sharing stuff
10:01 

10:01 and then people comment and I learn from
10:04 

10:04 other people online it's more like you
10:06 

10:06 are the Forefront of you know organizing
10:09 

10:09 communities so you are the one who are
10:11 

10:11 actually initiating community events
10:14 

10:14 like I just find that so refreshing in a
10:17 

10:17 way like I wanted to be a part of that
10:20 

10:20 and so uh I joined February last year
10:23 

10:23 and immediately I knew that this is for
10:25 

10:25 me and like this is something I want to
10:26 

10:26 do um in my spare time this is what I
10:29 

10:29 want to do to give back um everything
10:31 

10:31 that I've received from the tech
10:32 

10:32 community so that's kind of the reason
10:34 

10:34 why I joined and I'm always super
10:35 

10:35 inspired by all our members like if you
10:38 

10:38 just talk to them they always have their
10:40 

10:40 own reasons for joining as well but when
10:42 

10:42 I find out about all their Reasons I'm
10:44 

10:44 always super inspired by each and every
10:46 

10:46 one of them that I had to write a blog
10:49 

10:49 post about it so I remember in the first
10:51 

10:51 week I joined we're just talking like
10:53 

10:53 for dinner for pizza and then
10:55 

10:55 immediately I was like suggesting let us
10:58 

10:58 like start this blog and create stuff
10:60 

10:60 and like there's just so many things to
11:02 

11:02 talk about with them cuz we are all
11:03 

11:03 passionate and we all have that same
11:05 

11:05 fire that we want to do something for
11:07 

11:07 the community so it's so easy to like
11:09 

11:09 you know be with the same like-minded
11:11 

11:11 type of people that you know can share
11:13 

11:13 that values I think it's really amazing
11:15 

11:15 so far yeah we will do a Shameless plug
11:18 

11:18 where we uh link uh Victoria's blog post
11:22 

11:22 with this video when it's post oh my
11:25 

11:25 okay so we'll do that all right yeah
11:27 

11:27 yeah but what about you Sal you
11:30 

11:30 literally like you're what does how did
11:31 

11:31 you become a director like okay so so
11:34 

11:34 how I started it was so very similar
11:36 

11:36 basically uh when I graduated I I was
11:40 

11:40 like not the only woman but one of the
11:42 

11:42 two woman engineers in my in the team
11:46 

11:46 and I did feel like wait I I need to see
11:49 

11:49 a few more of my kind of people to see
11:52 

11:52 that this is a sustainable career and
11:54 

11:54 there are women engineers at the top or
11:56 

11:56 you know senior women Engineers or
11:59 

11:59 something so then I came about other
12:01 

12:01 Tech communities like uh girls in Tech
12:04 

12:04 actually so so there are like uh Tech
12:07 

12:07 communities which are for everyone those
12:09 

12:09 are there so like Junior Dev SG uh and a
12:13 

12:13 few others angular Dev meetups and stuff
12:16 

12:16 but every time I would go for those
12:18 

12:18 community events it would be 100 men
12:21 

12:21 with like one or two women and it would
12:25 

12:25 be super super awkward uh I did not like
12:28 

12:28 that at all and so that that's why I was
12:31 

12:31 drawn more towards girls in Tech kind of
12:33 

12:33 community so with girls in Tech it was
12:36 

12:36 at that point it was I would join them
12:38 

12:38 so it's always like a telegram or like a
12:41 

12:41 slack app we would go for events
12:44 

12:44 together so events in that case would be
12:45 

12:45 like go to schools like primary schools
12:48 

12:48 secondary schools talk to girls have
12:50 

12:50 like a coding Workshop or like you know
12:52 

12:52 those D drag and drop coding kind of
12:54 

12:54 sessions scratch so yeah like scratch so
12:57 

12:57 then I would go for those events and
12:59 

12:59 then that when I realized like it's
13:01 

13:01 actually quite nice to be like kind of
13:02 

13:02 inspiring these young girls uh that you
13:05 

13:05 know I'm I'm a soft a job or you can be
13:07 

13:07 one to kind of thing so then that's how
13:10 

13:10 I got more involved with the with the
13:11 

13:11 community there were so many other women
13:13 

13:13 who were much uh senior than me in that
13:16 

13:16 time so I I was like Amazed by them like
13:19 

13:19 wow they're doing so much for the
13:20 

13:20 community like I should look up to them
13:22 

13:22 so then that's how I got involved in the
13:24 

13:24 community so then it it started going
13:26 

13:26 from girls in Tech which was more for
13:30 

13:30 which at that point felt more for like
13:31 

13:31 the younger girls and then I moved to
13:34 

13:34 Tech ladies another Community which was
13:36 

13:36 more for entry level developers wow it's
13:39 

13:39 a whole coming of age it's just so
13:42 

13:42 happened for me that way that it it
13:44 

13:44 became like that so then in Tech ladies
13:47 

13:47 we had like mentorship programs boot
13:49 

13:49 camps I got to be like a boot camp coach
13:51 

13:51 uh so that was great as well and then uh
13:54 

13:54 finally like woman who code was always
13:57 

13:57 uh around and uh at point but I never
13:60 

13:60 like went to those events yet or like I
14:03 

14:03 would attend some events uh somehow I
14:06 

14:06 got to know the previous director uh we
14:09 

14:09 we talked and then I expressed interest
14:12 

14:12 cuz she was leaving she was finding the
14:13 

14:13 next successor so we talked and I was
14:16 

14:16 like you know I've been a part of tech
14:18 

14:18 communities for quite some time I have
14:19 

14:19 been like doing events and stuff I might
14:23 

14:23 uh give give it a try actually cuz I am
14:26 

14:26 passionate about this I always want to
14:28 

14:28 see like more women and genus in my team
14:30 

14:30 cuz I feel men and women they bring
14:33 

14:33 different Dynamics to a team and I
14:36 

14:36 usually feel a bit more comfortable
14:37 

14:37 knowing that there's another female
14:39 

14:39 software developer like maybe not in the
14:41 

14:41 same team but maybe even in another team
14:43 

14:43 I can see her around right cuz Believe
14:45 

14:45 It or Not There are
14:47 

14:47 some uh I don't know discrimination or
14:50 

14:50 like uh
14:52 

14:52 some underconfidence kind of thing that
14:55 

14:55 does happen around a lot more confident
14:58 

14:58 men for example so so I I was drawn
15:01 

15:01 towards I was always passionate about
15:02 

15:02 having more women in Tech so therefore
15:05 

15:05 like then I went I came became the
15:07 

15:07 director at women who Cod uh that's
15:09 

15:09 where I started loving it because I
15:11 

15:11 started realizing that my leadership
15:13 

15:13 qualities like or like what I can
15:15 

15:15 improve on to you know be a better
15:18 

15:18 leader and I love being a leader now
15:22 

15:22 like and and of course like the reason
15:25 

15:25 why I stayed in a in a community is also
15:27 

15:27 because uh it's a volunteer thing so
15:30 

15:30 only when I'm free that's when I'll be a
15:32 

15:32 part of a event part of a boot camp or a
15:35 

15:35 program so everyone there uh with their
15:39 

15:39 own uh volunteer time so they have time
15:42 

15:42 therefore they are there and there's no
15:43 

15:43 like obligation or anything you work at
15:46 

15:46 your own time just ensure that we are
15:48 

15:48 designing a program that's doable that's
15:51 

15:51 you know that they'll bring value to
15:53 

15:53 others uh and of course the networking I
15:56 

15:56 think that's the most plus point about
15:59 

15:59 being in a community I actually now have
16:02 

16:02 a lot more software developer
16:04 

16:04 friends uh and you know seniors Juniors
16:08 

16:08 we all help each other out we learn from
16:10 

16:10 each other we will refer each other uh
16:13 

16:13 Give opinions I I just love that there's
16:16 

16:16 a support group kind of around us yeah I
16:20 

16:20 like how I like that I like that how you
16:22 

16:22 mentioned about networking because I
16:24 

16:24 think this is just my personal like
16:28 

16:28 myself I'm introvert so like the word
16:31 

16:31 networking scares me a lot like me
16:34 

16:34 imagine me going to networking events
16:36 

16:36 I'll just be in the corner like oh my
16:38 

16:38 God who do I talk to I'm so I would be
16:39 

16:39 like that too actually yeah so if I
16:42 

16:42 could so it's but see you push yourself
16:45 

16:45 you by becoming director you share you
16:48 

16:48 actually learn from it as well not only
16:49 

16:49 are you giving back to the community but
16:51 

16:51 you also gain something back in return
16:53 

16:53 definitely yeah so that's what I love
16:54 

16:54 about joining a community cuz I too um
16:57 

16:57 when I go in my mindset was like I'm
16:59 

16:59 going to give back but I didn't expect
17:01 

17:01 all these gifts back right I love that
17:04 

17:04 yeah so that is a huge part that I think
17:06 

17:06 a lot of people don't realize as well
17:08 

17:08 they say why am I doing my time
17:10 

17:10 volunteering for this like what if I
17:11 

17:11 don't have time or like that you can
17:13 

17:13 always make the time if you want to like
17:15 

17:15 if you prioritize it you can make the
17:17 

17:17 time and then who knows you'll get
17:19 

17:19 something back so that is something that
17:21 

17:21 it really um is important to me when I
17:24 

17:24 was doing all these Community I realized
17:26 

17:26 that oh it's so unexpected but you know
17:28 

17:28 all these people that I randomly meet is
17:30 

17:30 like it becomes a a network right like I
17:34 

17:34 didn't expect it but it's a great thing
17:36 

17:36 that came out from it yeah so what about
17:39 

17:39 Natasha I'm curious like is there
17:41 

17:41 anything that you've gained from joining
17:43 

17:43 woman who so far yeah I I think like um
17:46 

17:46 there's been a big difference into how
17:48 

17:48 you know I saw myself as an engineer
17:51 

17:51 prior to joining and then after joining
17:53 

17:53 I think prior to joining I was um
17:56 

17:56 obsessed with you know being technically
17:59 

17:59 good and wanting to prove myself as
18:02 

18:02 having that technical um competence um
18:06 

18:06 to be equal to my PS or like you know
18:09 

18:09 constantly trying to focus on that but I
18:11 

18:11 think after joining a community I
18:14 

18:14 realized a value of like sharing my
18:17 

18:17 experience and not so much needing to
18:19 

18:19 like prove to people that I'm good but
18:21 

18:21 to realize that wait there are so many
18:23 

18:23 people out there who are like so amazing
18:25 

18:25 in what they do but you know I don't see
18:27 

18:27 anybody as you know high up low up we
18:30 

18:30 all have like different experiences it's
18:32 

18:32 so hard to compare our even though we we
18:35 

18:35 can all call us our software Engineers
18:37 

18:37 you know in a group but at the same time
18:40 

18:40 we it's so hard to compare our
18:42 

18:42 experiences and say say who is better
18:43 

18:43 than the other because it um it's
18:46 

18:46 different everybody has their own
18:47 

18:47 Journeys and I also realize everybody
18:48 

18:48 has their own insecurities as well
18:50 

18:50 that's something that I think um I
18:52 

18:52 didn't expect to connect with a lot of
18:54 

18:54 people about be it whether you're a
18:56 

18:56 woman or a man like I think especially
18:59 

18:59 in Tech it can feel very lonely it can
19:01 

19:01 feel like the focus is only on being
19:04 

19:04 technically competent and because of
19:06 

19:06 that you're constantly trying to be
19:07 

19:07 better and there's a lot of insecurities
19:09 

19:09 driving that but it's only when you join
19:11 

19:11 a community and you realize everybody is
19:13 

19:13 their own in their own Journeys that you
19:15 

19:15 realize that that part is not important
19:19 

19:19 to your identity as like a person as an
19:21 

19:21 engineer it's about being in this
19:24 

19:24 community that's always learning and
19:25 

19:25 growing together learning through
19:27 

19:27 different experiences and I think that
19:29 

19:29 was the biggest part for me like really
19:32 

19:32 changing The Narrative of like my
19:33 

19:33 identity as an engineer so um that
19:36 

19:36 that's one part uh and I think the
19:38 

19:38 second part is also realizing that I
19:40 

19:40 have more to give as uh Beyond just
19:43 

19:43 being an engineer um so really expanding
19:45 

19:45 my identity uh uh outside of that so
19:48 

19:48 funnily enough I know like when I joined
19:50 

19:50 a community and then after that you know
19:52 

19:52 I started participating in the events
19:54 

19:54 helping out with mcing um reaching out
19:56 

19:56 to people um I didn't expect people to
19:59 

19:59 in the community to come up to me and
20:00 

20:00 say like how how are you doing these
20:02 

20:02 things like how are you so good at like
20:04 

20:04 networking I quot and quote because I'm
20:05 

20:05 still uncomfortable with that term
20:07 

20:07 because it's just making friends and
20:09 

20:09 connecting with people but networking
20:10 

20:10 makes it sound very LinkedIn you know I
20:12 

20:12 know I joked about I joke about LinkedIn
20:14 

20:14 a lot but still I still feel
20:15 

20:15 uncomfortable with that but you know
20:17 

20:17 even like talking and uh uh uh mcing and
20:20 

20:20 stuff like that I never wanted to
20:22 

20:22 identify with those skills in fact like
20:25 

20:25 actually before uh I decided to become a
20:27 

20:27 software engineer I consider going to
20:29 

20:29 Communications and becoming like a
20:30 

20:30 television show host and news anchor
20:32 

20:32 that was like my supposed P you would be
20:34 

20:34 great at that no the thing is like what
20:37 

20:37 stopped it was I actually went through
20:38 

20:38 like a uh radio hosting competition when
20:41 

20:41 I was 16 and I actually got through all
20:43 

20:43 the way to the finals and they told me I
20:44 

20:44 had to drop my old levels so I was just
20:46 

20:46 like what no obviously my parents say no
20:49 

20:49 and I was just like okay end of that
20:50 

20:50 dream but you know because of that and I
20:53 

20:53 thought like this skill kind of like um
20:56 

20:56 was too contrasting to being an engineer
20:59 

20:59 it feels like two different things and I
21:00 

21:00 didn't want people to say oh she's just
21:01 

21:01 like that engineer who like talks well
21:03 

21:03 so I actually for like many years of my
21:06 

21:06 life I didn't want to be associated with
21:08 

21:08 hosting with anything cuz I wanted
21:10 

21:10 suppressed this side of I suppressed so
21:12 

21:12 people would come to me and ask me hey
21:14 

21:14 do you want to help my company uh like
21:16 

21:16 my own organization and I'll be like no
21:18 

21:18 find somebody else like that's I'm a
21:20 

21:20 sofware engineer I am not a host and
21:23 

21:23 it's funny that coming into this
21:24 

21:24 community I realized like that skill of
21:27 

21:27 mine is actually helping
21:29 

21:29 you know uh people in the community
21:32 

21:32 helping more engineers get to know more
21:34 

21:34 about like the Techo even doing this
21:36 

21:36 right now yeah so I've started to like
21:39 

21:39 see that I don't need to choose between
21:41 

21:41 these two binaries I can be an engineer
21:44 

21:44 and be really good as like somebody who
21:46 

21:46 shares my ideas too and combining these
21:49 

21:49 two it helps other Engineers as well so
21:53 

21:53 why not so and now that's like one of
21:55 

21:55 the qualities in an engineer to be able
21:58 

21:58 to talk verbalize your thoughts exactly
22:01 

22:01 yeah I actually think this is so
22:02 

22:02 important and as to why so many
22:04 

22:04 Engineers have insecurities is because
22:05 

22:05 not many uh people in our community are
22:09 

22:09 stepping out to share to share their
22:11 

22:11 insecurities their Journeys their
22:13 

22:13 problems so it makes people feel very
22:15 

22:15 lonely as if they only they're the only
22:16 

22:16 ones faced with this I I really Envision
22:20 

22:20 a Envision a world but like you know
22:22 

22:22 more um people in a te Community
22:24 

22:24 stepping out and being really honest and
22:26 

22:26 vulnerable with their experiences and
22:28 

22:28 feeling like they don't don't need to be
22:29 

22:29 ashamed of that so that they can share
22:31 

22:31 this experience out to the world and
22:33 

22:33 people like you and me can connect to it
22:35 

22:35 and know that we're not alone because I
22:36 

22:36 know what it feels like to be alone to
22:38 

22:38 to feel like I have zero representation
22:40 

22:40 and what I'm going through it's just me
22:42 

22:42 it's all me but actually you know then I
22:46 

22:46 find out through this community it's a
22:48 

22:48 common experience and we have a lot of
22:49 

22:49 things to learn from that so sorry when
22:52 

22:52 in a whole thank you for sharing that
22:54 

22:54 that that must be like it's a big thing
22:57 

22:57 to share uh such a thing like actually
22:59 

22:59 uh like why why do people even think of
23:01 

23:01 such thing is because people at work
23:04 

23:04 they will talk right they'll be like oh
23:05 

23:05 you're so good at talking you should be
23:07 

23:07 a business person or you should go to
23:09 

23:09 the business department I don't know why
23:11 

23:11 they say such things and then they bring
23:13 

23:13 about this false sense of like oh
23:15 

23:15 Engineers should just be quiet yeah and
23:17 

23:17 what create more problems after solving
23:19 

23:19 some
23:20 

23:20 problems
23:22 

23:22 true like I don't know why people like
23:25 

23:25 create such uh stereotypes of uh
23:28 

23:28 different r
23:29 

23:29 uh basically yeah so uh yeah I think
23:35 

23:35 exactly it's it's because the
23:36 

23:36 stereotypes are so heartset and it's so
23:39 

23:39 heartset also because people don't talk
23:41 

23:41 about like we're more than just the
23:42 

23:42 stereotypes there's so many different
23:44 

23:44 types of like people in check and I
23:46 

23:46 think that's also the reason we started
23:47 

23:47 this podcast is realizing that we're all
23:49 

23:49 so different but how come like so much
23:51 

23:51 of the portrayal is like one static
23:53 

23:53 stereotype you know static oh my gosh
23:56 

23:56 like but yeah that's another thing that
23:58 

23:58 I uh I like saw in a community that
24:01 

24:01 happens is that many women especially
24:04 

24:04 they are actually really knowledgeable
24:06 

24:06 really smart at their in their work and
24:09 

24:09 like expert in their fields but they
24:11 

24:11 would never accept that they are they
24:12 

24:12 will be like oh yeah I'm still
24:13 

24:13 intermediate I'm still average or things
24:16 

24:16 and whereas the same in a men
24:18 

24:18 counterpart they'll be like yeah I know
24:20 

24:20 everything even though it might be same
24:22 

24:22 or even below right so I realized
24:25 

24:25 sometimes you just need to push certain
24:28 

24:28 members in the community and be like you
24:30 

24:30 know what you you just accomplished like
24:31 

24:31 this small project why don't you speak
24:34 

24:34 about this at this online event or like
24:36 

24:36 in this inperson event together with
24:38 

24:38 other people so that you don't feel
24:39 

24:39 alone and then just like like that
24:42 

24:42 little push actually you'll see like the
24:44 

24:44 whole the person just converts into this
24:47 

24:47 really confident person and you realize
24:49 

24:49 wait she speaks so well yeah like she's
24:52 

24:52 such a good teacher we didn't we didn't
24:54 

24:54 even know that unless we had pushed each
24:56 

24:56 other to do certain things so I actually
24:58 

24:58 have a very good example of this so
25:01 

25:01 there's this girl she's at the time she
25:03 

25:03 haven't joined us officially I don't
25:06 

25:06 know if I should mention her name but
25:07 

25:07 for now I don't um and she's always been
25:10 

25:10 quite shy so I remember when I first
25:12 

25:12 meet her she only like want to meet one
25:14 

25:14 on one and all that right cuz she's only
25:16 

25:16 comfortable talking with one person at a
25:18 

25:18 time but she's super knowledgeable and
25:20 

25:20 she definitely want to share like you
25:22 

25:22 know her knowledge and all that and I so
25:25 

25:25 I I suggested to her you know you can
25:27 

25:27 you know start a workshop you know you
25:29 

25:29 should like just run your own workshop
25:30 

25:30 I'll help you out with all the details
25:32 

25:32 and all that and then bam we just did it
25:35 

25:35 right you probably know who she is now
25:37 

25:37 but that's how she like I never know
25:39 

25:39 she's such an amazing speaker like she's
25:41 

25:41 been like hiding it in the closet like
25:43 

25:43 that I want to do all this but then she
25:45 

25:45 just need a little bit of push and then
25:47 

25:47 taada and she Blossom and I was like so
25:50 

25:50 proud of her at the end of the workshop
25:52 

25:52 series that she did and like a lot of
25:54 

25:54 these things that I think people don't
25:56 

25:56 realize their full potential unless
25:58 

25:58 they're like a part that support group
25:59 

25:59 and having that support system actually
26:02 

26:02 really helps a lot so going back to like
26:04 

26:04 why we join communities and how
26:06 

26:06 communities help us is really so that we
26:09 

26:09 can like you mentioned you know overcome
26:12 

26:12 that loneliness that you know that
26:14 

26:14 illusion that we're all doing this alone
26:16 

26:16 that we're lone wolves and actually
26:19 

26:19 being part of like a huge community that
26:21 

26:21 can actually support each other and help
26:23 

26:23 us grow together I think that is one of
26:25 

26:25 the biggest value that I see we got from
26:28 

26:28 communities another thing is that at
26:30 

26:30 least for me personally like you
26:32 

26:32 mentioned about the Lone Wolf it always
26:34 

26:34 feels like we're working in silos I I
26:37 

26:37 had a hard time asking for help cuz I
26:40 

26:40 always feel like that makes me feel like
26:42 

26:42 I am not knowledable or like
26:47 

26:47 incompetent and like because of my past
26:50 

26:50 background of not having formal CS
26:52 

26:52 education that feeds into my impostor
26:54 

26:54 syndrome furthermore if I were to ask
26:57 

26:57 for help so I I used to never want to
26:59 

26:59 ask for help or even ask for favors like
27:02 

27:02 can someone help me out with this like
27:04 

27:04 you know if I don't have the time like
27:05 

27:05 I'll just try to do everything by myself
27:08 

27:08 even if it cuts into my my personal time
27:11 

27:11 so that that was the thing I struggle
27:13 

27:13 with but you know since we're all out
27:15 

27:15 here sharing our insecurities now yeah I
27:19 

27:19 I think through woman hook code I
27:21 

27:21 managed to overcome that because I see
27:23 

27:23 that like you mentioned we're all
27:25 

27:25 technically in one way or another have
27:27 

27:27 these insecurities and all we need is
27:29 

27:29 just that support group that support
27:31 

27:31 system to be able to let us realize that
27:33 

27:33 hey it's not such a big deal like this
27:35 

27:35 is something we can overcome and this is
27:36 

27:36 something that we can also work on to uh
27:39 

27:39 towards improving you know especially
27:41 

27:41 with many diverse people from diverse
27:43 

27:43 background it can definitely cover our
27:45 

27:45 weaknesses cuz definitely we're not
27:47 

27:47 perfect and I do admit I'm I'm lacking
27:52 

27:52 but uh but that's why by meeting people
27:54 

27:54 from all across you know Womanhood code
27:57 

27:57 I get to actually see how I can improve
27:60 

27:60 I learn from them learn from their
28:01 

28:01 perspectives and that's also a huge part
28:04 

28:04 of why communi I remember when you
28:06 

28:06 joined you you uh shared with us your
28:08 

28:08 blog and right after I read I was
28:10 

28:10 inspired and I actually wrote like two
28:12 

28:12 to three articles for the next few weeks
28:15 

28:15 and then I I I shared it with you like
28:16 

28:16 hey by the way I also wrote articles
28:19 

28:19 inspired by you and yeah it was I just
28:22 

28:22 loveed that our community basically like
28:24 

28:24 like-minded people with different
28:26 

28:26 backgrounds coming together and we share
28:27 

28:27 a lot of our experience experiences and
28:29 

28:29 it's good to have a community separate
28:31 

28:31 from your workplace as well because then
28:33 

28:33 you can actually like talk openly about
28:37 

28:37 the experiences or like the feelings
28:38 

28:38 you're facing in your workplace with the
28:41 

28:41 this other community that's away from
28:43 

28:43 your work I like and then you can get
28:45 

28:45 some advice you can see like a different
28:47 

28:47 perspective to things and be like oh
28:49 

28:49 yeah that happened to me last year as
28:50 

28:50 well this is something that I did that
28:53 

28:53 helped me so I really like like having
28:55 

28:55 that separate group of friends to
28:59 

28:59 sh that portion actually you brought up
29:01 

29:01 a very good point because again if we're
29:03 

29:03 only like usually our co-workers is the
29:06 

29:06 people we spend the most time with like
29:07 

29:07 because it's Monday to Friday 9 to 5: so
29:10 

29:10 we're always only engaging with them
29:12 

29:12 that can lead to a lot of burnt out for
29:14 

29:14 different reasons so having a separate
29:17 

29:17 Community like you mentioned so you have
29:19 

29:19 another group of people that you can
29:21 

29:21 talk to and that kind of understands you
29:24 

29:24 in a way it actually puts some distance
29:27 

29:27 so in a way you're not burnt out you
29:29 

29:29 know like you can wind down and you can
29:31 

29:31 see what what else is there out there
29:34 

29:34 yeah yeah I think it's about like I I
29:35 

29:35 like what you said about creating that
29:37 

29:37 distance because it's about like you
29:39 

29:39 know if all you're surrounded with it's
29:41 

29:41 like people from work your worldview
29:43 

29:43 becomes just containing work and all the
29:45 

29:45 struggles that you face in work are like
29:47 

29:47 maximized they just seem so huge but the
29:50 

29:50 moment you step out into a community
29:51 

29:51 where people have so many different
29:53 

29:53 worldviews and you realize oh wait my
29:54 

29:54 problem is just like this small problem
29:57 

29:57 amongst like this entire
29:59 

29:59 like um slew of like different problems
30:01 

30:01 people face and yeah that distance helps
30:04 

30:04 you like you know reduce that burnout
30:06 

30:06 because you realize it's not that like
30:08 

30:08 you know the world is much bigger than
30:09 

30:09 that that people have so many different
30:11 

30:11 experiences so I I really like that you
30:13 

30:13 brought that part out because that's
30:14 

30:14 that's what happened for me I was so
30:16 

30:16 trapped within my little tiny world
30:19 

30:19 within my organization and all the
30:21 

30:21 problems I was faced with felt Amplified
30:24 

30:24 you know right but the moment I step out
30:25 

30:25 and I get to know like oh actually the
30:27 

30:27 world is much biger than just my
30:29 

30:29 organization you know there's so much
30:30 

30:30 more to
30:32 

30:32 explore yeah it helped me like reduce
30:34 

30:34 all that burnout and did you know have a
30:36 

30:36 healthy distance between my workplace
30:38 

30:38 and myself so I think that you brought
30:41 

30:41 that part out I also want to chap into
30:43 

30:43 like what you said like previously also
30:45 

30:45 that you really enjoy being this enabler
30:48 

30:48 to other people I also feel like that's
30:50 

30:50 a big part about running a community and
30:52 

30:52 I feel like that's you uh that's your
30:54 

30:54 role as like a director too to enable
30:56 

30:56 like participants and volunteers like uh
30:59 

30:59 ourselves to like step out of our
31:01 

31:01 comfort zones try things that we've
31:03 

31:03 never done before like uh in your
31:04 

31:04 example like somebody who has never
31:06 

31:06 spoken on like a uh platform before and
31:10 

31:10 you realize wow you have so much hidden
31:11 

31:11 potential I think that's the the magic
31:13 

31:13 of like running a community as well yeah
31:15 

31:15 and think especially for you you've seen
31:17 

31:17 so many different people come through
31:19 

31:19 yeah and I feel like you're very
31:20 

31:20 deliberate in that in giving people that
31:23 

31:23 space yeah and I understand cuz I was
31:26 

31:26 that person I sometimes still become
31:28 

31:28 that person person where I need someone
31:30 

31:30 to push me a little bit so then I also
31:32 

31:32 have like my group of friends within my
31:34 

31:34 community where they know that okay I
31:35 

31:35 think SL needs a push so then like go
31:38 

31:38 ahead do it do it this is a deadline for
31:40 

31:40 you do it before before Fab or
31:43 

31:43 something that's how your first
31:46 

31:46 Deadlight so yeah that's nice yeah so I
31:49 

31:49 I think uh like if if you relate to like
31:52 

31:52 any one of us like our audience if you
31:54 

31:54 relate to any one of us or I we
31:56 

31:56 definitely feel being a part of
31:58 

31:58 Community being in Tech and then being a
31:60 

31:60 part of a Tech Community is definitely
32:02 

32:02 beneficial for us in various different
32:05 

32:05 ways and I would always recommend like
32:09 

32:09 any fresh graduate or like midc career
32:12 

32:12 uh Tech person to be in touch with a
32:15 

32:15 Comm with a Tech Community that
32:16
