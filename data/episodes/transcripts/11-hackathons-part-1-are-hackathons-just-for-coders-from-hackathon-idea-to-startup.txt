00:00 a lot of hackathons people think that
00:02 

00:02 only developers join them and only you
00:05 

00:05 must know how to code heatons being a
00:07 

00:07 really good place to get validation for
00:09 

00:09 ideas you've had for a long long time
00:11 

00:11 the nvp that we built it was more about
00:13 

00:13 the slides the way I presented the
00:16 

00:16 product
00:17 

00:17 [Music]
00:20 

00:20 itself hello everybody we have rect tag
00:22 

00:22 and this is the place for bites and
00:24 

00:24 ventor I'm Natasha I'm a software
00:26 

00:26 engineer I'm saloni software developer
00:28 

00:28 and I'm Victoria Solutions engineer and
00:30 

00:30 together we have rag today our episode
00:33 

00:33 is going to be about hackathons um so to
00:35 

00:35 start off I'm going to start off with
00:37 

00:37 the person who has most recently done a
00:39 

00:39 hackathon and that person is me Victoria
00:43 

00:43 so yeah how was your experience like
00:45 

00:45 doing that hackathon do you want to tell
00:46 

00:46 us all about it yeah sure so basically
00:49 

00:49 heatons is something that I do kind of
00:51 

00:51 on and off whenever I see there's time
00:53 

00:53 or like there's something I want to
00:54 

00:54 learn from so the recent Heaton I joined
00:57 

00:57 is the hash node API Heaton where you
00:59 

00:59 have to use a hash node API like
01:01 

01:01 integrated into some app and like sorry
01:03 

01:03 sorry to interrupt you but I realized
01:04 

01:04 that we didn't explain what a hackathon
01:06 

01:06 was so yeah do you want to like start
01:08 

01:08 off okay sure so heatons are basically
01:11 

01:11 like timed kind of like events where you
01:14 

01:14 you have a deadline to complete a
01:16 

01:16 project within that time so it can range
01:19 

01:19 from 48 hours to like even weeks or
01:22 

01:22 months even longer than that basically
01:24 

01:24 the goal of hackaton is to meet people
01:26 

01:26 build project together and submit it by
01:28 

01:28 the end of the whole deadline by the
01:31 

01:31 deadline so usually they'll have a bunch
01:33 

01:33 of different deliverables like usually
01:35 

01:35 an MVP of the app and then a video for
01:38 

01:38 the demo and then maybe a presentation
01:40 

01:40 so depending on the hackathon and
01:42 

01:42 hackathons would usually at the end of
01:43 

01:43 the deadline would have like some prizes
01:45 

01:45 so let's say you know if you're top
01:47 

01:47 three top five depending on the hecaton
01:49 

01:49 you'll get prizes in the form usually of
01:52 

01:52 like monetary or like Amazon credits or
01:54 

01:54 things like that yeah so that's
01:56 

01:56 essentially what heatons is is a place
01:58 

01:58 for developers to work together to build
02:00 

02:00 a project yeah and innovate create
02:03 

02:03 create stuff together yeah so for me
02:05 

02:05 I've been joining hackaton for a while
02:07 

02:07 now so many I couldn't count but the
02:10 

02:10 recent hackathon I joined is the hash
02:12 

02:12 node API hackathon where you have to use
02:14 

02:14 hash node apis to build an app to
02:17 

02:17 integrate to build an app so what I
02:19 

02:19 built is actually a AI generated
02:21 

02:21 learning path app so you know how hash
02:24 

02:24 node is a blogging platform for those
02:25 

02:25 who don't know hash no is a blogging
02:27 

02:27 community and platform it has many
02:28 

02:28 technical articles there when you want
02:31 

02:31 to go in and learn something I noticed
02:33 

02:33 that there's just too many articles it's
02:35 

02:35 saturated right now so I want to learn
02:36 

02:36 flutter and then I search up flutter in
02:39 

02:39 the search bar and there will be a lot
02:40 

02:40 of articles on flutter and I'm a
02:42 

02:42 beginner and I don't know where to start
02:44 

02:44 cuz I have no knowledge of flutter so
02:46 

02:46 I'm not sure which article I should read
02:48 

02:48 first what is the order and all that and
02:50 

02:50 so after I identified this use case I
02:52 

02:52 decided to create an AI learning path
02:54 

02:54 generator where you can write down what
02:56 

02:56 you want to learn and then they'll take
02:57 

02:57 like fetch hash note articles from the
02:59 

02:59 API I and then they'll generate you an
03:01 

03:01 optimized learning path based on like
03:04 

03:04 your current difficulty level yeah so
03:07 

03:07 that is essentially my project and I
03:09 

03:09 kind of joined the Heaton late it was a
03:10 

03:10 three we Heaton but I joined it like you
03:12 

03:12 know the last seven
03:15 

03:15 days yeah cuz at the time I was like you
03:17 

03:17 know just thinking like should I join
03:19 

03:19 this heon or not so I wasn't really sure
03:22 

03:22 up until like the last seven days I got
03:24 

03:24 the idea and like okay now I now I wow I
03:27 

03:27 want to do this you know I just want to
03:29 

03:29 build it so
03:30 

03:30 um the process of doing this hackaton is
03:34 

03:34 is at least for me I just paired up with
03:36 

03:36 my partner as usual so she's a software
03:39 

03:39 engineer and to be honest with you we
03:41 

03:41 don't have like a super extensive
03:43 

03:43 background in machine learning but we do
03:46 

03:46 have we have built machine learning
03:48 

03:48 projects before so we're familiar with
03:49 

03:49 the process and because we work together
03:52 

03:52 a lot on different hackathons we kind of
03:54 

03:54 know each other strengths so immediately
03:56 

03:56 7 days left we just you know start
03:58 

03:58 assigning task you know you did this and
04:00 

04:00 this part like that and what we did is
04:03 

04:03 we built an ml model that can actually
04:06 

04:06 predict the difficulty level of an
04:08 

04:08 article so after it predicts the
04:10 

04:10 difficulty level of an article it'll
04:12 

04:12 arrange it from easy to hard and then
04:14 

04:14 it'll generate that learning path for
04:16 

04:16 you so I would say right now because we
04:18 

04:18 have to manually label the Articles it's
04:20 

04:20 not a really perfect model we do notice
04:23 

04:23 like some articles would have like two
04:25 

04:25 different Topics in one article like
04:27 

04:27 flutter with graphql for example how do
04:29 

04:29 you determine the difficulty level for
04:31 

04:31 that so there's a lot of these like
04:33 

04:33 little little hiccups that we notice and
04:35 

04:35 in every heatons there's always little
04:37 

04:37 hiccups that sure and it's also in a
04:39 

04:39 very short amount of time as compared to
04:42 

04:42 as much time you would have if you're
04:44 

04:44 actually building it into an at for
04:46 

04:46 company right so with a hackathon you
04:48 

04:48 you have to solve all these problems in
04:50 

04:50 a very small amount of time and that's
04:52 

04:52 why we basically kind of just overcome
04:54 

04:54 it by so there's two ways to overcome
04:57 

04:57 like these kind of hiccups first is we
04:59 

04:59 just put them off for now cuz it's like
05:01 

05:01 it's not part of the MVP like you know
05:03 

05:03 we don't have to include it yet and then
05:05 

05:05 the most important feature yeah so it's
05:07 

05:07 also prizing like identifying which
05:09 

05:09 feature we have to include in the MVP
05:11 

05:11 and then the second part is let's say we
05:13 

05:13 have to include it no matter what then
05:15 

05:15 we'll try to just brute force it for now
05:17 

05:17 you know yeah yeah yeah you know like so
05:19 

05:19 for me like for example I was trying to
05:21 

05:21 figure out the difficulty level like how
05:23 

05:23 do you how does the model can identify
05:26 

05:26 difficulty level there's a lot of things
05:27 

05:27 right like article length you know um
05:29 

05:29 complexity of the words terms and all
05:31 

05:31 that so um at first there's all these
05:34 

05:34 features we want to put in the model but
05:36 

05:36 then since due to lack of time in the
05:38 

05:38 end we just manually label like that so
05:41 

05:41 Brute Force you know so it takes a lot
05:43 

05:43 of Labor to be honest but at the end of
05:46 

05:46 the day I'm happy with the outcome at
05:48 

05:48 least we managed to make a very simple
05:50 

05:50 website that can predict learning path
05:52 

05:52 generating so I'll say that's the most
05:54 

05:54 rewarding part about hecton is at the
05:57 

05:57 end of the day you will have a project
05:59 

05:59 yeah even no matter how big or small
06:01 

06:01 it's something and then it's something
06:03 

06:03 that you learn from you take away from
06:05 

06:05 building this yeah so that's that's been
06:07 

06:07 my experience so far yeah and this was
06:10 

06:10 basically last week right that last two
06:13 

06:13 weeks last two weeks so You' have been
06:15 

06:15 like doing this hack for the last two
06:16 

06:16 weeks and you said like you're
06:17 

06:17 consistently joining hackathons on and
06:20 

06:20 off actually on and off okay okay yeah
06:22 

06:22 and the main thing that you take away
06:24 

06:24 from it is that each time you get
06:26 

06:26 rewarded by like having an actual
06:27 

06:27 product and project that will assume
06:29 

06:29 like uh if you know somebody was coming
06:32 

06:32 in new to Tech and they wanted to put
06:33 

06:33 more things in their portfolio this is a
06:35 

06:35 good way to start I I would think and
06:37 

06:37 also like that entire experience of like
06:39 

06:39 you have this very condensed period of
06:42 

06:42 time and you're faced with problems and
06:43 

06:43 you have to go through the practice of
06:45 

06:45 like prioritizing what other important
06:47 

06:47 things you want to build to make this a
06:48 

06:48 minimum demonstratable product which is
06:51 

06:51 also a very important uh concept as well
06:53 

06:53 and I wanted to tap on this and you know
06:54 

06:54 share uh uh my own experience this time
06:57 

06:57 not just being a participant of the
06:60 

06:60 hackathon but uh being one of the
07:01 

07:01 mentors and actually you you you were
07:04 

07:04 one of the mentors too I was also a
07:05 

07:05 hackathon judge and Mentor yeah yeah it
07:08 

07:08 was for uh um showcase uh which is
07:11 

07:11 another uh platform it's like LinkedIn
07:13 

07:13 for developers but again to expose their
07:15 

07:15 uh API application uh programming
07:18 

07:18 interface to like other people to use
07:20 

07:20 and I realized a lot of companies do
07:21 

07:21 this um to kind of like uh advertise
07:24 

07:24 their product uh especially for
07:26 

07:26 developer tools they use hackathons to
07:28 

07:28 get people to try them and also I think
07:30 

07:30 to get feedback on their product as well
07:32 

07:32 so that's one way um like like one
07:35 

07:35 reason why companies uh engage in
07:36 

07:36 hackathons so being a mentor there I
07:39 

07:39 realized like uh I I realized that a lot
07:41 

07:41 of these uh projects that people are
07:43 

07:43 showing me they're so talented like a
07:46 

07:46 lot of uh engineers and participants of
07:48 

07:48 these hackathons are so tal technically
07:50 

07:50 talented like I couldn't developed that
07:52 

07:52 in that short uh span of time so I was
07:54 

07:54 really thinking in terms of me being a
07:56 

07:56 mentor what can I contribute I can't
07:59 

07:59 contribute anything that's really
08:01 

08:01 technical because it really involves
08:02 

08:02 like going deep down and if I go down
08:04 

08:04 and nitpick like oh actually this could
08:06 

08:06 be better it's also very very like silly
08:08 

08:08 because I know you have a constrainted
08:09 

08:09 amount of time so I realized what I
08:11 

08:11 ended up being able to give value to was
08:14 

08:14 more of like how me looking uh at this
08:17 

08:17 as a product perspective do I think that
08:20 

08:20 you've developed features that people
08:21 

08:21 would really use are these really like
08:23 

08:23 the minimum viable features that
08:25 

08:25 demonstrate the full potential of your
08:27 

08:27 idea so that's kind of like where I kind
08:29 

08:29 of switch gears instead of like
08:31 

08:31 commenting on like the technical um
08:33 

08:33 details of like oh you should be
08:35 

08:35 implementing this and that I realized
08:36 

08:36 like giving my perspective of how we
08:39 

08:39 should look at this as a product is this
08:41 

08:41 the best uh demonstration of uh your
08:44 

08:44 idea was actually helpful to the
08:46 

08:46 participants and um that was my takeaway
08:49 

08:49 as a mentor as well for the hackathon um
08:52 

08:52 realizing that there are so many Talent
08:54 

08:54 talented people out there but you know
08:56 

08:56 as um coming in from the third party
08:59 

08:59 perspective I realized like a lot of
09:00 

09:00 people appreciate that feedback on ideas
09:03 

09:03 everybody wants feedback on their ideas
09:05 

09:05 and I think hackathons are a really good
09:06 

09:06 way to do that you have an idea at the
09:08 

09:08 back of your head and you just want
09:10 

09:10 people to tell you like um is it good is
09:12 

09:12 it bad to improve on it so um that was
09:15 

09:15 one um yeah experience that I wanted to
09:17 

09:17 bring up like Vis be like what you said
09:20 

09:20 yeah that's nice sooney for yourself
09:22 

09:22 like I would imagine I can imagine you
09:24 

09:24 organizing headphones like would that be
09:26 

09:26 right I have not ever actually organized
09:29 

09:29 one oh yeah I thought you but okay like
09:32 

09:32 you uh I have not participated in a
09:34 

09:34 hecaton for a few years now but I was
09:37 

09:37 quite actively involved in heatons as
09:39 

09:39 well so similar experiences as yourself
09:43 

09:43 uh Victoria so uh I used to I used to go
09:46 

09:46 for heatons but my uh aim was to come up
09:50 

09:50 with a I had a few startup ideas so I
09:53 

09:53 wanted to like get my startup off at
09:56 

09:56 heatons cuz that's where you know the
09:58 

09:58 judges are ALS so investors and things
10:01 

10:01 like that and also to validate the idea
10:03 

10:03 maybe uh sometimes I would go for
10:05 

10:05 heatons as a developer where I'll just
10:08 

10:08 see who has a better idea and I'll go to
10:10 

10:10 their team and then work on their idea
10:13 

10:13 and learn from their experiences so I
10:15 

10:15 used to go back to back quite a few
10:16 

10:16 heatons it was a really good experience
10:19 

10:19 for me I used to love it at that point
10:21 

10:21 learned a lot of things especially in
10:24 

10:24 terms of uh presentation actually so for
10:28 

10:28 me the most the more the more uh
10:31 

10:31 beneficial thing was how to present uh
10:35 

10:35 nvp so like after going for a few heon I
10:37 

10:37 started getting the hang of what works
10:40 

10:40 well so like I started winning a few
10:42 

10:42 heatons after a few uh practices so and
10:46 

10:46 I realized it wasn't about the product
10:49 

10:49 uh the MVP that we built it was more
10:51 

10:51 about the slides and the way I presented
10:54 

10:54 uh the product itself so like
10:57 

10:57 storytelling way like the problem and
11:00 

11:00 then solve the problem and then oh voila
11:03 

11:03 this solution works like that and then
11:06 

11:06 in that kind of man and then there was
11:07 

11:07 also like Shark Tank kind of things
11:10 

11:10 happening where you know I'm asking for
11:12 

11:12 like this m this much
11:14 

11:14 $100,000 with this much stick in the
11:16 

11:16 company and this is how you do what and
11:19 

11:19 what so it was so startups can be like
11:21 

11:21 the tech hecaton kind and it could also
11:24 

11:24 be the other part of it which is the
11:25 

11:25 product hecaton bit bit of it where you
11:29 

11:29 also have run through numbers and things
11:31 

11:31 like that uh and your MVP can just be a
11:33 

11:33 figma app kind of thing it doesn't have
11:36 

11:36 to be a running with a server and a
11:38 

11:38 front end it could just be a prototype
11:41 

11:41 of how it's going to be look how it's
11:42 

11:42 going to look like yeah basically
11:43 

11:43 whatever you need to demonstrate your
11:45 

11:45 idea doesn't have to be like coded out
11:47 

11:47 and like deployed like in production so
11:50 

11:50 like some I realized some heckadon uh
11:52 

11:52 they actual working solution was very
11:55 

11:55 impressive then yes it did make sense
11:57 

11:57 that you if you can code it out and
11:60 

11:60 wow you have already built it but I'm I
12:03 

12:03 don't know how true it is that they
12:05 

12:05 built it during that time frame per so I
12:08 

12:08 used to do very short he I don't like to
12:10 

12:10 be in the same space for like seven days
12:12 

12:12 it'll be too stressful so I'll just do
12:14 

12:14 like one day heatons or maximum two days
12:18 

12:18 where the second day you have to
12:19 

12:19 actually just present already so usually
12:23 

12:23 you wouldn't be able to get that much
12:25 

12:25 work done but uh still we used to be
12:27 

12:27 able to like just use like mean stack
12:30 

12:30 which is a like a web stack that you can
12:33 

12:33 use to quickly boot boot up like a basic
12:37 

12:37 front end with like some words and some
12:39 

12:39 like Google Maps integration at that
12:42 

12:42 time Google Maps integration or like
12:44 

12:44 some API calling to get some live
12:46 

12:46 updates RSS feeds things like that so it
12:50 

12:50 was fun times it will teach you how to
12:52 

12:52 like quickly uh hack your way out and
12:56 

12:56 get a product working with lots of if
12:58 

12:58 else and call
13:00 

13:00 AI yeah yeah yeah so I I used to love it
13:03 

13:03 that you know we can like mask all of
13:05 

13:05 these things and just use these words
13:07 

13:07 and voila this is a product and then I
13:11 

13:11 would put that on my resume because I we
13:13 

13:13 did kind of build it or this was an idea
13:15 

13:15 I did go through the ideation process
13:18 

13:18 and lots of you get to meet lots of
13:20 

13:20 people as well so used to like team up
13:23 

13:23 with strangers or like those who already
13:26 

13:26 have an idea maybe to learn from them
13:28 

13:28 you know like what have you already done
13:30 

13:30 and things like that yeah I actually
13:32 

13:32 love what you said about like hackathons
13:34 

13:34 being a really good place to show to
13:36 

13:36 just Implement and get validation for
13:39 

13:39 ideas you've had for a long long time
13:41 

13:41 because while every hackathon is
13:42 

13:42 different you know the ability to like
13:44 

13:44 adapt your idea to kind of like uh
13:46 

13:46 adapted to the problem statement of that
13:48 

13:48 hackathon that by itself is a very like
13:50 

13:50 fun Challenge and just having this
13:52 

13:52 platform to Showcase it to people and
13:54 

13:54 get validation to know like is would
13:56 

13:56 this be good if I actually turn it up
13:58 

13:58 and start up and I I a lot of startups
13:60 

13:60 are like spin off like these hackathons
14:02 

14:02 too so um yeah on that like that was
14:04 

14:04 exactly what I did for um this hackathon
14:06 

14:06 that I was a participant of it's a City
14:08 

14:08 hack it's by aom which is this U
14:10 

14:10 multinational developer and they had
14:12 

14:12 like various problem State statements on
14:14 

14:14 sustainability actually uh I was coming
14:17 

14:17 in with uh one of like my my research uh
14:20 

14:20 ideas on like predicting technology
14:23 

14:23 trajectories honestly it looks very
14:25 

14:25 different sustainability and predicting
14:27 

14:27 technology TR trajectory
14:30 

14:30 but I think the fun part was like how
14:32 

14:32 how can I make my like this idea that I
14:34 

14:34 have like implementable to like um this
14:36 

14:36 problem statement and I somehow uh with
14:39 

14:39 my team managed to marry it in such a
14:41 

14:41 way that one of the problem statements
14:43 

14:43 was like Black Swan events and
14:44 

14:44 disruptions to supply chain and I was
14:47 

14:47 just like wait if you can predict like
14:49 

14:49 technological like disruptions it could
14:51 

14:51 relate to supply chain and we could
14:53 

14:53 easily change that use case and I think
14:55 

14:55 that whole process was really amazing um
14:58 

14:58 it was less about like like the product
15:00 

15:00 actually like actually developing I just
15:02 

15:02 came up with a very rough it was Vanilla
15:04 

15:04 like HTML GS like and that took up the
15:07 

15:07 least amount of time the one that took
15:09 

15:09 the most amount of time was the slides
15:10 

15:10 like like really learning the skill of
15:13 

15:13 like being able to put your ideas
15:15 

15:15 forward in a suing concise and elevator
15:17 

15:17 pitch manner to talk about like really
15:20 

15:20 concisely what is the problem I'm trying
15:21 

15:21 to solve and this is my solution I think
15:24 

15:24 that's one of the biggest skills you can
15:25 

15:25 get out of a hecaton because not just
15:27 

15:27 about like this being a skill to you
15:29 

15:29 know like build a future startup it's
15:31 

15:31 also about like the skill you need to
15:33 

15:33 advocate for yourself at work if you
15:34 

15:34 think about it you're negotiating for
15:36 

15:36 this promotion for example how would I
15:38 

15:38 pitch the idea of me fitting into this
15:40 

15:40 position it's the same skill so
15:42 

15:42 hackathons are a really good way to like
15:44 

15:44 practice that skill and we always talk
15:46 

15:46 about how like um you know people and
15:47 

15:47 Tech Engineers tend to lack these
15:49 

15:49 platforms I I think like hackathons are
15:51 

15:51 a great platform to marry like you're
15:53 

15:53 already uh doing engineering plus also
15:56 

15:56 like the additional part of the soft
15:57 

15:57 skills of like pitching yourself so
15:59 

15:59 that's one the second part I really like
16:01 

16:01 like was when you said it's really about
16:03 

16:03 the networking and making friends aspect
16:05 

16:05 so uh I actually just came at from Hong
16:07 

16:07 Kong and like so this um heckadon I
16:10 

16:10 participated back in 2022 the uh aeom
16:14 

16:14 organized it and the digital director of
16:16 

16:16 aom was one of the uh main organizers um
16:19 

16:19 and I actually made friends with him and
16:21 

16:21 this last trip that I meet like uh less
16:23 

16:23 than a month ago to Hong Kong I reached
16:25 

16:25 out to him and say like hey like
16:27 

16:27 actually we had a great conversation and
16:29 

16:29 L last time and uh in the last two years
16:31 

16:31 I've done a lot in like the um like Tech
16:34 

16:34 space I really would like to link up and
16:36 

16:36 I linked up with him like two years
16:37 

16:37 later in Hong Kong in a different city
16:39 

16:39 and we started sharing about all these
16:40 

16:40 ideas and connecting again it was
16:42 

16:42 amazing I learned more about the
16:44 

16:44 intersection between the built
16:45 

16:45 environment and the digital space again
16:47 

16:47 and these are things I can bring back to
16:49 

16:49 my work right now so I think it's really
16:51 

16:51 great that you can meet people through
16:52 

16:52 hackathons people that you would never
16:54 

16:54 thought of meeting not just the
16:55 

16:55 participants but it organizes themselves
16:57 

16:57 too um which is also like when we were
16:59 

16:59 the mentors of like showcase as well
17:01 

17:01 yeah meeting the participants was also
17:03 

17:03 amazing and forging like these new bonds
17:05 

17:05 so yeah actually now that I think about
17:08 

17:08 it um even though I've really only been
17:10 

17:10 in like not not many heck not not as
17:12 

17:12 many as you Victoria and for yourself
17:14 

17:14 you have been like out is of the
17:16 

17:16 hackathon space because like well you're
17:18 

17:18 senior engineer now like me every day
17:20 

17:20 it's a heath for
17:22 

17:22 you so actually this is a myth that a
17:25 

17:25 lot of heatons people think that only
17:28 

17:28 develop ERS join them and only you must
17:31 

17:31 know how to code or you must be at least
17:33 

17:33 Junior developer cuz senior developers
17:35 

17:35 do know so there's a lot of myths
17:37 

17:37 surrounding heatons and I would like to
17:39 

17:39 debunk that one of them is hecaton is
17:41 

17:41 not only for coders so people who don't
17:43 

17:43 code can also join so I've been in
17:45 

17:45 heatons where product managers marketing
17:48 

17:48 people uiux designers they join in and
17:52 

17:52 actually they bring so much value to the
17:53 

17:53 team because that way our team is not so
17:55 

17:55 saturated with only people who think of
17:57 

17:57 programming but they also think of the
17:59 

17:59 end user and like the problem and how to
18:01 

18:01 pitch like you both mentioned knowing
18:03 

18:03 how to pitch your idea is it's like 70%
18:07 

18:07 of how I'm going to win the hecaton the
18:09 

18:09 product is good and all but if you're
18:11 

18:11 unable to articulate why is it good then
18:14 

18:14 how are you going to Stand Out Among the
18:16 

18:16 rest so because I join a lot of heatons
18:19 

18:19 my most recent experiences they're all
18:21 

18:21 online hackathons and probably due to CO
18:24 

18:24 as well but back then when I was like in
18:26 

18:26 physical heatons where I have to like
18:28 

18:28 sleep over bring a sleeping bag and like
18:30 

18:30 I've never done that oh my go yeah bro
18:32 

18:32 sleeping bag but Indiana I only sleep 2
18:33 

18:33 hours because it's like 48 hour Heaton
18:36 

18:36 so when I bring a sleeping bag and all
18:38 

18:38 that and then we actually meet people on
18:40 

18:40 the day off and form teams on the day
18:42 

18:42 off like you mentioned the value is like
18:45 

18:45 really being able to like network with
18:47 

18:47 those people and not only that you you
18:50 

18:50 actually have to come up with a very
18:51 

18:51 engaging pitch like within two days like
18:54 

18:54 technically one and a half days so that
18:56 

18:56 skill is also something that you know
18:58 

18:58 most people can take away from after you
19:00 

19:00 know doing hackathons and that's
19:02 

19:02 something that I want to highlight as
19:04 

19:04 well yeah but overall the myth is that
19:06 

19:06 you don't have to know how to code or
19:09 

19:09 people are also intimidated to join
19:10 

19:10 because they say what if I don't have an
19:12 

19:12 idea so like why what son say like if
19:14 

19:14 you don't have like an idea that you
19:15 

19:15 want to validate or test you can just
19:17 

19:17 simply join a team and just learn about
19:20 

19:20 you know maybe this company's products
19:22 

19:22 that they want to or like this company's
19:24 

19:24 Pro problem statements that they're
19:26 

19:26 trying to like ask you to solve so doing
19:28 

19:28 that you can also gain inspiration from
19:30 

19:30 like the people that you meet and your
19:31 

19:31 team so there's a lot of benefits to
19:34 

19:34 joining heatons yeah
19:37 

19:37 overall yeah I I also wanted to add
19:40 

19:40 there that uh dur why are these heatons
19:43 

19:43 like you said like you and your partner
19:45 

19:45 you you guys knew that what are the
19:48 

19:48 strengths and weaknesses so then you
19:49 

19:49 used you leveraged on that so after
19:51 

19:51 going for a few heatons I started
19:53 

19:53 realizing that uh you know working under
19:57 

19:57 very high pressure was not a thing for
19:59 

19:59 me but I could be good in like the other
20:01 

20:01 aspects where if if it's U if like the
20:05 

20:05 time is really an issue maybe I can be I
20:08 

20:08 can be like a certain level in
20:09 

20:09 presenting but then if there's someone
20:11 

20:11 else I can take on the other role or I
20:14 

20:14 can do it that way so even that allowed
20:16 

20:16 me to understand that oh I can actually
20:17 

20:17 do presentation or I can work on a death
20:20 

20:20 work I can even like help with UI ux as
20:23 

20:23 well yeah I think discovering like what
20:26 

20:26 you can do and what you can actually
20:28 

20:28 like learn and improve on is also a huge
20:31 

20:31 deal like where I said like in my day
20:32 

20:32 job I would just do the coding part I
20:34 

20:34 would never have to do any presentation
20:37 

20:37 any I would have to look at the uiux of
20:40 

20:40 bit of it so that that's where we got to
20:41 

20:41 learn so many things and find your
20:43 

20:43 strengths and weaknesses it helps you
20:45 

20:45 try on different hats right which is
20:46 

20:46 really good yeah yeah so from Natasha's
20:50 

20:50 like point of view cuz you don't join a
20:51 

20:51 lot of hecton but you have joins heatons
20:54 

20:54 um is there any kind of benefit that you
20:58 

20:58 personally like experience
21:00 

21:00 or I I think like uh firstly like the
21:04 

21:04 people that you meet and you learn from
21:07 

21:07 because like you said you know they're
21:08 

21:08 not just Developers for the hackathons
21:10 

21:10 I've joined actually they weren't like
21:12 

21:12 developer Centric um they were just like
21:14 

21:14 very broad-based it's about like show us
21:17 

21:17 like this uh idea that will solve this
21:19 

21:19 problem statement um but definitely like
21:22 

21:22 there was a um Tech aspect to it like uh
21:25 

21:25 perhaps AWS or like Google will be like
21:27 

21:27 a partner and they will give you like a
21:29 

21:29 Sandbox to try out like with credits and
21:31 

21:31 stuff like that which was a bonus for
21:33 

21:33 the demo um but because of that I got to
21:35 

21:35 meet like you know UI ex designers you
21:38 

21:38 you get to meet like people from
21:39 

21:39 marketing you got to to know people even
21:41 

21:41 from like HR like all over the world and
21:44 

21:44 just putting ourselves in like this
21:45 

21:45 small little team and seeing where our
21:47 

21:47 strengths and weaknesses could help each
21:49 

21:49 other develop something in a very short
21:51 

21:51 amount of time because at the point of
21:53 

21:53 time like you put egos aside because all
21:55 

21:55 you're gunting for is like I only have
21:56 

21:56 like two days like yeah let's just see
21:58 

21:58 like what we're good at you know it's
21:59 

21:59 not like in a workpace environment um
22:02 

22:02 where you know I I feel like ego does
22:04 

22:04 come into play a lot and you're just
22:05 

22:05 like yeah I'm good at this like I should
22:07 

22:07 do this if I do this like um like it
22:10 

22:10 will boost my uh I don't know my reviews
22:13 

22:13 um but you know when it comes to having
22:15 

22:15 to do things being forced to like
22:17 

22:17 deliver something a very short amount of
22:19 

22:19 time you discard that it's just like
22:21 

22:21 whatever gets the product like out and
22:23 

22:23 demonstratable and I really like that
22:25 

22:25 aspect of it it's very similar to like
22:27 

22:27 working in a a leaner up which is what I
22:30 

22:30 enjoy like zero to one products um and I
22:33 

22:33 feel like hackathons are even more
22:34 

22:34 condensed version of it and just being
22:36 

22:36 able to like go through these hackathons
22:38 

22:38 um I think puts me in a very good place
22:40 

22:40 to start like new products you know and
22:44 

22:44 with like I would say the uh more
22:47 

22:47 relevant mindset where all I'm doing is
22:50 

22:50 I'm focused on like delivering this
22:52 

22:52 demonstratable product oh I'm okay with
22:54 

22:54 it feeling all I want is like idea Val
22:56 

22:56 validation I feel like I learn all these
22:58 

22:58 through like hackathons like largely
23:01 

23:01 yeah obviously the other um so one like
23:04 

23:04 meeting different people from all walks
23:06 

23:06 of life to learn from like their skill
23:08 

23:08 sets different hats like you said which
23:10 

23:10 makes me appreciate my job scope and my
23:13 

23:13 work even more so now I have like an
23:15 

23:15 understanding of like say the uiux
23:17 

23:17 designer who's next to me what he's like
23:19 

23:19 involved in how I can help yeah two um
23:22 

23:22 just learning um what it takes to like
23:26 

23:26 do something like a startup um yeah and
23:28 

23:28 having being able to practice that start
23:31 

23:31 up lean start up mindset in like these
23:33 

23:33 hackathon spaces that's two um and just
23:37 

23:37 three being able to put myself forward
23:39 

23:39 and gain that validation as a person you
23:42 

23:42 know like um being there to pitch to try
23:45 

23:45 different things I think it really
23:46 

23:46 boosts your confidence when you step out
23:48 

23:48 of the comfort zone and realize like I
23:50 

23:50 can actually like make something out of
23:52 

23:52 this you know you understand New
23:54 

23:54 Perspectives about yourself you're
23:55 

23:55 putting yourself in a very uncomfortable
23:58 

23:58 tight environment to do different things
23:60
