00:00 these are things that people outside of
00:01 

00:01 tech um like they hear
00:05 

00:05 about
00:07 

00:07 nice
00:10 

00:10 [Music]
00:13 

00:13 okay welcome to re Tech y uh this is
00:16 

00:16 where we indulge in bites and banter uh
00:19 

00:19 we'll start off with introductions I'm
00:20 

00:20 Salone a software engineer I'm Victoria
00:23 

00:23 Solutions engineer and I'm Natasha
00:25 

00:25 software engineer yes and today we'll be
00:27 

00:27 talking about some common debates that
00:30 

00:30 we have have in our Tech life Tech
00:33 

00:33 culture so one uh let's start off with
00:36 

00:36 like the very very obvious one which
00:39 

00:39 always has a binary when it comes to
00:42 

00:42 like software people it is light mode
00:45 

00:45 versus dark mode so let's start with
00:48 

00:48 like Victoria what's your preferred mode
00:51 

00:51 dark mode actually we should start with
00:53 

00:53 like uh describing what this actually
00:55 

00:55 means I think a lot of people might
00:57 

00:57 think that it's just like switching on
00:58 

00:58 the night mode and the oh it applies to
01:01 

01:01 everything even like um vs code theme so
01:05 

01:05 like the code editor I use it'll be all
01:07 

01:07 full and dark and now even Chrome web
01:10 

01:10 browsers have a dark mode light mode so
01:12 

01:12 we're talking about YouTube that kind of
01:14 

01:14 dark mode light mode yeah and I think
01:16 

01:16 this is important for uh people who uh
01:18 

01:18 are in Tech because we deal with our
01:20 

01:20 computer so much it's literally a bread
01:22 

01:22 and butter that uh this preference for
01:25 

01:25 light mode versus dark mode which
01:26 

01:26 actually um pertains a lot more to uh
01:29 

01:29 the co-editors we use yes um but at the
01:31 

01:31 same time like you said it's more of
01:33 

01:33 like in general what kind of mode do you
01:35 

01:35 prefer your computer to be in and I
01:37 

01:37 realized this is not uh just like a tech
01:39 

01:39 debate right I think everybody has their
01:41 

01:41 own preference it's just more prevalent
01:43 

01:43 in Tech because I think a lot of people
01:45 

01:45 when they watch like popular media on
01:47 

01:47 like hackers and stuff all they see is
01:49 

01:49 the dark mode it's always like dark mode
01:50 

01:50 but actually everybody has a preference
01:52 

01:52 and it's very similar to like um your
01:54 

01:54 own personal preference for a computer
01:56 

01:56 but yeah yeah I think when anyone like
01:59 

01:59 think of the word word software engineer
02:01 

02:01 they think they imagine a dark room and
02:03 

02:03 then they are on the dark computer dark
02:06 

02:06 mode and I fit into that stereotype I do
02:08 

02:08 I you do I do too it's just that my room
02:11 

02:11 is dark my room is not dark but my
02:13 

02:13 computer is quite dark with its
02:15 

02:15 Terminals and like my my code editor is
02:18 

02:18 dark but surprisingly my Chrome is light
02:22 

02:22 mode oh oh why why do you think that oh
02:26 

02:26 it's just like default and you just
02:27 

02:27 don't want to like touch it I have
02:29 

02:29 touched it tried dark mode on Chrome but
02:32 

02:32 then it started looking very gloomy
02:33 

02:33 gloomy like too much gloomy too much Glo
02:36 

02:36 I don't know it's just I prefer my cator
02:39 

02:39 in dark mode but everything else should
02:41 

02:41 be light and colored like I have a
02:44 

02:44 purple theme uh Macbook so all the
02:47 

02:47 windows that opens the tile above is
02:49 

02:49 purple color oh actually my bub sh oh
02:52 

02:52 yes favorite color and now that you
02:55 

02:55 mention it right I I'm really 100% dark
02:59 

02:59 like back before Chrome has that release
03:01 

03:01 that there's the Dark mode I have to
03:03 

03:03 hardcode my OS software so that
03:06 

03:06 everything open will be dark you hard
03:09 

03:09 Cod it you're there's like a custom
03:12 

03:12 chrome you can window settings dark so
03:17 

03:17 everything will be dark yeah but it's
03:19 

03:19 like not the off yeah so even why
03:22 

03:22 Windows like you know the operating
03:25 

03:25 system like usually it will be white
03:26 

03:26 with the accent color yours is purple
03:29 

03:29 mine is just dark
03:30 

03:30 and then the blue accent
03:33 

03:33 oh I don't know why well both of you are
03:36 

03:36 dark mode with one Chrome that's purple
03:39 

03:39 I guess I'm I think I'm majority light
03:42 

03:42 actually um but mine actually differs in
03:44 

03:44 terms of time of day and like my
03:46 

03:46 mood so majority of the time like um uh
03:51 

03:51 I if I'm using my desktop especially
03:53 

03:53 it's on light mode my code editors are
03:55 

03:55 usually on light mode um and but it can
03:58 

03:58 just be like the heart white high high
04:00 

04:00 contrast white um like light mode um it
04:04 

04:04 has to have some sort of color to it
04:05 

04:05 that's like more soft and I think
04:07 

04:07 usually pastel in like nature so I have
04:10 

04:10 this like more beigy um color theme that
04:13 

04:13 I use as well as a more purplish kind of
04:15 

04:15 past can we like put a screenshot of
04:18 

04:18 what your okay okay yeah yeah we can do
04:20 

04:20 that we can do that oh didn't we do it
04:22 

04:22 in our intros we did it on Instagram
04:26 

04:26 like on our social media so but I don't
04:27 

04:27 know if anyone noticed that like one
04:30 

04:30 more time in like our team yes yes okay
04:34 

04:34 we will put like little Snippets up on
04:35 

04:35 like this podcast just for fun um but
04:38 

04:38 yeah I think in terms of co-editor
04:40 

04:40 that's usually my go-to but I realized
04:42 

04:42 like once the sun sets um maybe because
04:45 

04:45 of I cream or I don't know what or
04:46 

04:46 Things become brighter I would change it
04:48 

04:48 to dark mode there like for code editor
04:52 

04:52 but I think like for Mo but for all the
04:55 

04:55 things outside of coeditor my entire
04:56 

04:56 phone is like dark
04:58 

04:58 mode but I think I us yeah I put like
05:00 

05:00 system white dark mode for everything um
05:03 

05:03 I think a lot of it was to save battery
05:06 

05:06 actually I read somewhere that because
05:07 

05:07 you know you're not using like a lot
05:09 

05:09 more uh electricity and dark mode so I
05:11 

05:11 use that but I've just kind of gotten
05:13 

05:13 used to it and that's also like
05:14 

05:14 scrolling at night with all like yeah I
05:18 

05:18 even have an additional app to like
05:20 

05:20 reduce the brightness even lower than
05:22 

05:22 the system brightness oh wao yeah so
05:25 

05:25 that when I use my phone at night I
05:27 

05:27 don't like stream oh that's good that's
05:29 

05:29 Co
05:30 

05:30 I actually do remember this one time
05:32 

05:32 where so I was working on my computer
05:35 

05:35 and when I referred to my colleague's
05:37 

05:37 computer he's using light mode on the
05:39 

05:39 editor I was like oh my ey my
05:43 

05:43 ey I wasn't I wasn't like dramatizing it
05:47 

05:47 it was actually quite painful to look at
05:49 

05:49 it cuz I was like in my dark mode editor
05:53 

05:53 mode and I looking at his like oh oh my
05:56 

05:56 God oh my eyes my eyes I actually relate
05:60 

05:60 to that because I have a similar story
06:02 

06:02 and I was just passing by just passing
06:05 

06:05 by the desk not even like looking to see
06:07 

06:07 the cat and I can see something very
06:09 

06:09 white and bright and I like ever it's
06:11 

06:11 like your eyes are not accustomed to it
06:13 

06:13 yeah whatever that is I don't want to
06:14 

06:14 look at the screen yeah but that's so
06:17 

06:17 Rel there's so this common stereotype
06:19 

06:19 like all the tech memes that you see
06:21 

06:21 everybody scared of the of the light mod
06:23 

06:23 person yeah I think this is a stereotype
06:25 

06:25 it's like majority of uh us I think use
06:29 

06:29 like dark mode uh uh most of the time
06:31 

06:31 but that one person that uses light mode
06:34 

06:34 especially the high contrast white
06:37 

06:37 background um uh light mode it's just
06:40 

06:40 like we fear you either that or we
06:42 

06:42 detest you who is that person can you
06:45 

06:45 imagine walking in an office and
06:46 

06:46 everybody like has their computers on
06:48 

06:48 but you will always know that one person
06:50 

06:50 mod light mode but of course we don't
06:52 

06:52 want to like say like light mode no like
06:55 

06:55 I'm all for like you know people's own
06:57 

06:57 preferences um I like how you also
06:59 

06:59 mentioned you adjust based on the time
07:01 

07:01 of day I think that's actually a healthy
07:03 

07:03 way to do it like to have Best of Both
07:04 

07:04 Worlds cuz I know that when I'm too
07:07 

07:07 immersed in darkness I for forgot to
07:10 

07:10 open my curtains you don't know if it's
07:12 

07:12 there night yeah like I have to look at
07:15 

07:15 the clock at the bottom the bottom you
07:17 

07:17 literally like block out black out
07:19 

07:19 curtains and then you just put on the
07:20 

07:20 hoodie I mean I don't have hoodies too
07:23 

07:23 hot
07:24 

07:24 but but I would see the clock so I know
07:27 

07:27 what time it is really need to work with
07:30 

07:30 the sun in general like I I just
07:32 

07:32 actually feel unproductive if I don't
07:34 

07:34 know like what time of day is so it like
07:36 

07:36 you you scare me the fact that like you
07:38 

07:38 like black out curtains and then you
07:40 

07:40 just work and you only look at the clock
07:41 

07:41 that's your only indication it's like
07:42 

07:42 dark and I'll I'll light a candle wow so
07:46 

07:46 cozy I mean that's just how I prefer to
07:49 

07:49 work that's so extra I'm sorry yeah I
07:52 

07:52 know I'm extra but then some people
07:53 

07:53 would like come in my room and open the
07:56 

07:56 curtain and I'll be like so what I do to
07:60 

07:60 this cuz I know like that's there's the
08:01 

08:01 importance of you know balancing right
08:04 

08:04 which I think you are great at so what I
08:06 

08:06 try to do to be less dark is I just got
08:10 

08:10 myself a
08:12 

08:12 plant what explain explain because you
08:17 

08:17 she has no I'm just like because when
08:20 

08:20 you got yourself a plant the plant needs
08:23 

08:23 the
08:24 

08:24 Sun so I will remember to like like I
08:27 

08:27 was in my dark room one day and I saw
08:29 

08:29 one leaf fall like oh I forgot to bring
08:33 

08:33 it out so I on my open my curtains like
08:37 

08:37 you know 10 cm and give it the sun it's
08:40 

08:40 the best thing
08:42 

08:42 ever but that's why that's one use of
08:44 

08:44 the pl if you see my Vlog in my about
08:46 

08:46 page I put my coding environment dark
08:49 

08:49 and I mean it literally some people
08:51 

08:51 think I I just put it there but no no
08:54 

08:54 you're like dark screen dark room dark
08:55 

08:55 everything yeah so I'm like the
08:58 

08:58 stereotype but interesting I I'm trying
09:01 

09:01 to be less of that so I'm trying to
09:03 

09:03 learn you know from you the sun does
09:06 

09:06 this hurt your eyes uh that's why
09:09 

09:09 actually this is a common TMI within my
09:12 

09:12 team is that if I stay in the office too
09:14 

09:14 long I will be so drained because the
09:16 

09:16 office lights are so white I will go
09:20 

09:20 into like a random Booth like in the
09:22 

09:22 office that's dark and I'll just
09:23 

09:23 recharge there for a while wow I'll came
09:27 

09:27 come out your reverse photosynthesizer
09:30 

09:30 oh my God I I don't know why but you do
09:33 

09:33 know that you need the sun right vitamin
09:34 

09:34 D is important that's why I take vitamin
09:37 

09:37 D oh my gosh I do have it on my Dash two
09:41 

09:41 bottles so one is like the capsule form
09:43 

09:43 and one is like the Milky candy
09:46 

09:46 form that's those are the things that
09:48 

09:48 like people in like London have to eat
09:51 

09:51 just to not get like seasonal uh
09:53 

09:53 depression but you're literally imposing
09:56 

09:56 that on yourself and you're like that's
09:58 

09:58 why I've not been sick
09:60 

09:60 technically I'm okay because I have my
10:03 

10:03 vitamins but but yeah I know it's very
10:06 

10:06 bad habit so I'm trying to like this a
10:09 

10:09 new thing I'm learning about Victoria I
10:10 

10:10 love it like when I started a
10:12 

10:12 conversation at light Mo versus dark W I
10:13 

10:13 didn't know she was like at that other
10:15 

10:15 extreme I am the definition of dark mod
10:18 

10:18 of dark I don't know it's me I I wear
10:21 

10:21 dark
10:22 

10:22 clothes I would have imagined that that
10:24 

10:24 was you actually but for you you're just
10:28 

10:28 she's like you're you're like neutral
10:29 

10:29 dark just chaotic like unlawful dark I'm
10:32 

10:32 unhinged dark
10:36 

10:36 unhinged I need to see the plant every
10:38 

10:38 day we need to check it on the plant oh
10:39 

10:39 you should see before and after before
10:41 

10:41 the plant was so full of leaves and now
10:43 

10:43 it's like it's it's like a coconut you
10:47 

10:47 see how many plants I have there oh my
10:50 

10:50 gosh your
10:51 

10:51 motivation much I don't have enough I
10:55 

10:55 only have one but it already looks like
10:57 

10:57 a palm tree because only the two upper
10:58 

10:58 leaves are
11:02 

11:02 okay it's
11:03 

11:03 okay okay getting back to the light mode
11:07 

11:07 versus dark mode so what we have
11:09 

11:09 realized is that personal preferences uh
11:13 

11:13 usually it is a stereotype that
11:15 

11:15 developers do use dark mode because I
11:18 

11:18 guess it's the the perception that we
11:20 

11:20 see right like usually screens are dark
11:23 

11:23 and when yeah and there are a fewers
11:26 

11:26 that do use the light mode and we judge
11:28 

11:28 them
11:30 

11:30 but but it's totally yeah it it depends
11:33 

11:33 what what your ice can take what how if
11:36 

11:36 it's better for you to read true cuz
11:38 

11:38 depends how long you're spending on the
11:39 

11:39 computer as well and things like that so
11:42 

11:42 yeah that's always going to be a debate
11:43 

11:43 I think it's not all developers use uh
11:47 

11:47 dark mode we have light mode users we
11:50 

11:50 have hybrid users and we have very
11:51 

11:51 extreme users yes yes and uh some people
11:54 

11:54 ask me how do you like how does your eye
11:56 

11:56 work in the dark right so I have blue
11:59 

11:59 light filter on these glasses and I blue
12:03 

12:03 light filter on this phone so everything
12:07 

12:07 by the way so that's how I keep my eyes
12:10 

12:10 from being so strained and I think
12:12 

12:12 whether you're a light M person or dark
12:14 

12:14 mood person you can do things to keep
12:16 

12:16 your eyes healthy right so ultimately
12:18 

12:18 it's about preference and keeping eyes
12:21 

12:21 healthy and having like healthy habits
12:23 

12:23 of taking eye breaks as well you should
12:25 

12:25 be looking out looking away from screens
12:28 

12:28 and things like that look at greener
12:30 

12:30 yes yes not just at one plant Greenery
12:34 

12:34 Greenery everywhere exactly everywhere
12:37 

12:37 nice nice okay we need this topic will
12:40 

12:40 bring us here but is hilarious I love
12:43 

12:43 that I found out so much more about you
12:45 

12:45 like such a TM love it okay on to the
12:49 

12:49 next on to the next the next one that we
12:52 

12:52 have is startup versus mang M M M do you
12:58 

12:58 want to Define what like yes so uh where
13:01 

13:01 this comes in is usually when we are
13:04 

13:04 like as teis as we are trying to look
13:06 

13:06 for a new job to switch to or to join
13:09 

13:09 should we join a startup which is a new
13:12 

13:12 company starting out where you will get
13:15 

13:15 much more things to do much more things
13:18 

13:18 to learn a little bit more chaotic less
13:21 

13:21 structure uh maybe there only two to
13:23 

13:23 three engineers in the beginning and
13:26 

13:26 versus a mang which is even even for
13:29 

13:29 mang that is the top tier which would be
13:31 

13:31 the mang which is meta Amazon Netflix I
13:36 

13:36 don't know why Netflix is there actually
13:37 

13:37 that was always my question why is
13:39 

13:39 Netflix there I have no idea I don't
13:40 

13:40 know if it's actually there
13:42 

13:42 recommendation system so actually so fun
13:45 

13:45 fact why why is mang mang right why are
13:48 

13:48 these companies in the mang it's
13:49 

13:49 actually because of their share
13:53 

13:53 value so if it's above it's the top few
13:56 

13:56 companies or it's it's above a certain
13:58 

13:58 thing I can remember so that's why they
14:00 

14:00 are M so that's why actually changes
14:03 

14:03 sometimes so Microsoft is also there
14:06 

14:06 Amazon uh Airbnb I think it came in once
14:09 

14:09 and then I don't know if it's still
14:10 

14:10 there so yeah so there's this bunch of
14:12 

14:12 companies and then there's also the the
14:14 

14:14 mid tier ones which would be uh Sony and
14:19 

14:19 you know things like that so they are
14:20 

14:20 they also there and then there also a
14:22 

14:22 few lower TI your ones so it's just like
14:25 

14:25 an umbrella like mang is just an
14:26 

14:26 umbrella term to talk about like really
14:28 

14:28 big high high Share value compies
14:33 

14:33 function correct so now uh why why is it
14:37 

14:37 even a startup versus this thing is
14:39 

14:39 because the experience you get working
14:42 

14:42 in a startup or working in mang or even
14:45 

14:45 like a mid tier company would be very
14:47 

14:47 different so you have to choose decide
14:50 

14:50 what you want and how it works so would
14:53 

14:53 any of you like to share like some pros
14:56 

14:56 cons of like working in startup working
14:58 

14:58 in mang uh yeah maybe I can start first
15:01 

15:01 so I literally encountered this
15:03 

15:03 situation uh in early in my career where
15:06 

15:06 I was offered two jobs one in a startup
15:09 

15:09 and one in a very highly valued public
15:12 

15:12 company so I asked the interviewer a lot
15:16 

15:16 of questions that day I remember I was
15:18 

15:18 asking I was as if I'm interviewing the
15:21 

15:21 interviewer because I wanted to know
15:24 

15:24 what are the advantages and
15:26 

15:26 disadvantages and I recognized there's a
15:27 

15:27 tradeoff so I just want to be
15:29 

15:29 transparent in that process that saying
15:31 

15:31 that I do have a job offer right now um
15:35 

15:35 so I'm just considering you as one of
15:37 

15:37 the options it took me a while to
15:39 

15:39 actually I created a pros and cons table
15:42 

15:42 That's My Style um and I realize that
15:46 

15:46 what I value in startup is you get to
15:49 

15:49 really be a voice your voice is more
15:52 

15:52 likely to be heard in such a small team
15:54 

15:54 and you get to take on different roles
15:56 

15:56 so it is definitely less structured and
15:59 

15:59 Celtic as you mentioned but if it's
16:01 

16:01 something that you want to like you know
16:03 

16:03 start learning right away that is
16:05 

16:05 something that you would maybe want to
16:08 

16:08 choose startup for basically like you
16:09 

16:09 want to learn a lot of things at once
16:11 

16:11 quickly and you want and you need to be
16:13 

16:13 able to adapt fast and then you like
16:15 

16:15 that fast-paced
16:17 

16:17 culture um and then the next one is the
16:20 

16:20 bigger company so that one you'll have
16:21 

16:21 more structure you'll go into the
16:23 

16:23 company there's a nice onboarding
16:25 

16:25 process for you you'll probably have a
16:27 

16:27 buddy assigned and everything just seems
16:29 

16:29 so natural it's like orientation when
16:31 

16:31 you first go into University right so
16:34 

16:34 institutional you know yeah so if you
16:37 

16:37 want that kind of like oh this is the
16:39 

16:39 right way to on board this is the right
16:41 

16:41 structure to have you know to have HR
16:43 

16:43 dealing with HR things for you you know
16:46 

16:46 then you everyone wears their own hats
16:49 

16:49 and you just do what you are SC yeah so
16:52 

16:52 the thing about that is that eventually
16:54 

16:54 you'll get quite specialized in that
16:56 

16:56 skill so if that's something what you're
16:58 

16:58 looking to build like being specialized
16:60 

16:60 and like really only focusing on doing
17:02 

17:02 one thing at a time then that is maybe
17:06 

17:06 the reason why you might choose a a
17:08 

17:08 bigger company yeah so at the end of the
17:11 

17:11 day I chose to go with like a bigger
17:14 

17:14 company first U it's just my personal
17:16 

17:16 preference just because I want to find
17:18 

17:18 out like a structure you know what is a
17:21 

17:21 normal like a normal like a a scalable
17:23 

17:23 organization will look like what does a
17:26 

17:26 product that has been scaled look like
17:29 

17:29 and how are they assigned like task to
17:31 

17:31 different people how is the organization
17:33 

17:33 structured and how things work in a
17:36 

17:36 bigger organization so that's just my
17:38 

17:38 personal preference but I'm definitely
17:40 

17:40 curious what you guys have to say about
17:43 

17:43 this I think for me um it's it's kind of
17:48 

17:48 strange to also kind of um describe my
17:51 

17:51 own experience because uh I've been in
17:53 

17:53 startups and I've been I am in a big
17:56 

17:56 organization right now but that big
17:58 

17:58 organization ation doesn't have a
17:59 

17:59 structure and process around what to do
18:02 

18:02 with um the the technical uh roles in
18:06 

18:06 their uh business function so I ended up
18:10 

18:10 kind of being a startup within a large
18:13 

18:13 organization yeah but in terms of like
18:15 

18:15 the both of your experiences where you
18:17 

18:17 are already in a um h a business where
18:22 

18:22 the tech fun functions are a heavy part
18:24 

18:24 of that domain and it's a big company so
18:26 

18:26 there's established processes around how
18:28 

18:28 like product teams work and stuff like
18:29 

18:29 that I haven't been in that uh scenario
18:32 

18:32 but um I have this more hybrid scenario
18:35 

18:35 where I know how like a big organization
18:36 

18:36 with structures and processes around
18:38 

18:38 established business functions work but
18:40 

18:40 at the same time they don't have
18:41 

18:41 established functions around um the
18:44 

18:44 technical uh side of things so I ended
18:46 

18:46 up doing a sh up so um in terms of that
18:49 

18:49 experience because I've um kind of had
18:52 

18:52 that I would say very clearly that for
18:54 

18:54 myself personal preference wise I know I
18:57 

18:57 thrive in more of a sort of kind of C
18:59 

18:59 that's where my main skill set lies
19:00 

19:00 that's where my personality thrives the
19:03 

19:03 bested because uh before I went into
19:06 

19:06 sofware engineering uh as a formal role
19:09 

19:09 um I was holding a different kind of
19:12 

19:12 position in a big organization where
19:14 

19:14 there was structures and processes
19:16 

19:16 already before I went to college
19:17 

19:17 actually and I knew I didn't really like
19:21 

19:21 um that process where uh my personal my
19:25 

19:25 personality is that I question
19:27 

19:27 everything if things don't seem right I
19:28 

19:28 want to be able to raise questions and I
19:31 

19:31 hope that these questions seat thoughts
19:32 

19:32 in people and U my intuition is that
19:35 

19:35 this should um kind of bring people
19:37 

19:37 together and we should Co like like get
19:39 

19:39 together to solve uh that problem and
19:41 

19:41 change that structure and process but I
19:43 

19:43 think with like um an established
19:47 

19:47 organization or at least for the
19:48 

19:48 organization I was in and am in right
19:51 

19:51 now um there wasn't a culture around
19:53 

19:53 that and I felt very different from
19:56 

19:56 everybody else so I could identify that
19:58 

19:58 but at that point point of time I didn't
19:59 

19:59 know what other options were available
20:01 

20:01 for me out there uh then when when I
20:03 

20:03 started to do my own startup and then
20:05 

20:05 eventually um know what it's like
20:08 

20:08 working at it structure I realize I like
20:10 

20:10 uh moving fast in small small teams
20:12 

20:12 where everybody is aligned uh to the
20:13 

20:13 same goal I like having like um autonomy
20:17 

20:17 as well um and having the freedom to uh
20:20 

20:20 have different ideas and solve a lot of
20:22 

20:22 problems in a fast-paced team with
20:23 

20:23 people I know and trust rather than
20:26 

20:26 having to relate them to a larger organ
20:28 

20:28 ganizational objective that isn't even
20:31 

20:31 like clear to me in the first place um
20:34 

20:34 and also I I just realized I'm really
20:36 

20:36 bad at like fighting politics I don't
20:38 

20:38 know if both of you like um experien
20:40 

20:40 this in your organizations but in a big
20:42 

20:42 um
20:43 

20:43 organization a lot of different people
20:45 

20:45 and individuals different stakeholders
20:47 

20:47 have different goals um and it's very
20:50 

20:50 difficult to align them into one
20:51 

20:51 organizational goal especially when they
20:53 

20:53 have different interpretations of it and
20:55 

20:55 I realize that seats a lot of like
20:57 

20:57 um uh I don't want to say unprofessional
21:00 

21:00 behavior but just Behavior I don't
21:02 

21:02 understand um because I'm a very
21:04 

21:04 rational and logical individual so for
21:06 

21:06 all those reasons I knew I wasn't um I
21:09 

21:09 wasn't going to thrive in that
21:11 

21:11 environment um but I've carved a space
21:13 

21:13 for myself in this large environment to
21:15 

21:15 build a startup and an isolated little
21:17 

21:17 bubble to practice and build an
21:20 

21:20 environment uh like a startup that I
21:22 

21:22 knew I would thrive in so um yeah I know
21:26 

21:26 like I went into a lot of natural
21:28 

21:28 explain but I think this is also a
21:29 

21:29 reflective process for me like now if I
21:32 

21:32 look towards like what do I want to do
21:34 

21:34 next um I kind of know I don't want to
21:37 

21:37 work in M actually um unless the offer
21:41 

21:41 that was put on on the table was more of
21:43 

21:43 like Can you short like a startup within
21:45 

21:45 like the larger company maybe an R&D um
21:47 

21:47 or like a Pathfinder kind of uh position
21:50 

21:50 yeah I I would definitely consider that
21:52 

21:52 um but I think top of my hit definitely
21:55 

21:55 um being in a startup I starting my own
21:57 

21:57 uh startup with uh be the best fit for
21:59 

21:59 my personality and that's where I will
22:01 

22:01 Thrive so yeah I think the conversation
22:04 

22:04 on Startup versus mang um for me it's a
22:09 

22:09 very clear preference only because I've
22:11 

22:11 gone through the process of
22:12 

22:12 understanding how it looks like um but I
22:15 

22:15 think um for uh you you literally were
22:18 

22:18 offered those two options on a table so
22:20 

22:20 it's kind of uh interesting that at that
22:22 

22:22 point because you did that was your
22:24 

22:24 first job right at that point sort of
22:26 

22:26 yeah like basically uh it was my first
22:28 

22:28 job in Tech so that's something like I
22:31 

22:31 want to explore first like on a bigger
22:33 

22:33 scale and then maybe in the future I
22:36 

22:36 would move to that kind of starup
22:38 

22:38 culture so in a way I don't have like a
22:40 

22:40 strong preference like you you are very
22:42 

22:42 sure that you you would want starup
22:43 

22:43 Culture Your for me it would depend on
22:46 

22:46 like my current goals at the time and it
22:49 

22:49 would depend on what I want to learn and
22:51 

22:51 want to focus on at the time yeah yeah
22:53 

22:53 like that what you want to learn yeah
22:55 

22:55 yeah yeah what about uh so I I've I've
22:59 

22:59 worked in uh startup before I've never
23:02 

23:02 worked in like the mang mang but maybe a
23:04 

23:04 a mid tier company uh so so I so
23:09 

23:09 truthfully speaking I always wanted to
23:11 

23:11 be in uh mang cuz you know it comes with
23:14 

23:14 its Prestige it comes with the high pay
23:18 

23:18 and uh working with like very the
23:21 

23:21 Imagine like the interview process is so
23:22 

23:22 difficult to get into those companies
23:24 

23:24 that if you do get in you're one of the
23:26 

23:26 top few people around so I wanted I
23:30 

23:30 wanted that for myself but uh over time
23:33 

23:33 I did real I realize like especially
23:35 

23:35 with like Co like all the tech layoffs
23:38 

23:38 happening and I realized uh I always
23:40 

23:40 thought that oh if I got into a man
23:42 

23:42 company it would be a very stable job
23:45 

23:45 and you know high paying stable job this
23:47 

23:47 is very working with people uh in that
23:50 

23:50 sorts but then when these Tech leops
23:52 

23:52 happen like okay nothing is stable
23:56 

23:56 nothing can be taken for granted so so
23:59 

23:59 that's when uh kind of like I started
24:02 

24:02 like taking the place where I'm at more
24:06 

24:06 for for Value that okay I don't have to
24:09 

24:09 be in those kind of companies to have
24:11 

24:11 that kind of prestige and things like
24:13 

24:13 that I can also find that in the other
24:15 

24:15 companies which are not mentioned in in
24:17 

24:17 M but they're also neighbors to that or
24:20 

24:20 like a little bit lower or something so
24:22 

24:22 it's not all about the name uh also I've
24:26 

24:26 been I've worked in Earth I wouldn't
24:28 

24:28 like I would not like to conclude my
24:31 

24:31 experience with startups with just
24:33 

24:33 because I've worked in one
24:35 

24:35 startup uh so it it was very interesting
24:39 

24:39 actually like you mentioned you get to
24:41 

24:41 wear different hats you have a say and
24:44 

24:44 but also there are also downsides to
24:45 

24:45 that that there because there wasn't a
24:48 

24:48 structure we would do things like you
24:50 

24:50 know in a hacky way for example get
24:52 

24:52 things out ASAP don't don't test that
24:55 

24:55 much don't write test maybe just test it
24:57 

24:57 out if it works it would work for the
24:59 

24:59 customer and like so uh things like that
25:02 

25:02 so if I if like a new graduate comes in
25:06 

25:06 and they ask should I Jo a startup or a
25:08 

25:08 mang I would say depends both have pros
25:12 

25:12 and cons uh just know that what you'll
25:16 

25:16 be losing out in a startup and what
25:17 

25:17 you'll be losing out in a m and I would
25:20 

25:20 say try both in your career and
25:23 

25:23 eventually try both eventually you
25:24 

25:24 should try both and learn both sides of
25:27 

25:27 it yeah
25:28 

25:28 because the pros from startup if you
25:30 

25:30 bring it to your big Large Scale Company
25:34 

25:34 it would also benefit uh if you bring
25:36 

25:36 your structured your best practices that
25:39 

25:39 you have the Liberty to practice in a
25:41 

25:41 big company to a startup you also bring
25:43 

25:43 a lot of value to that aspect uh and
25:46 

25:46 also like your goals in life if you
25:48 

25:48 eventually want to be opening own
25:50 

25:50 startup or something maybe startup is
25:52 

25:52 the better route for you see experiment
25:54 

25:54 that way if you are okay with a
25:56 

25:56 corporate job or uh if you like
25:58 

25:58 structure in your life things like that
26:01 

26:01 the large scale companies might be
26:03 

26:03 better for you yeah uh but definitely
26:05 

26:05 like if you ask me I think I had a very
26:08 

26:08 wrong perception of like mang Prestige
26:11 

26:11 name uh like only with experience I
26:15 

26:15 understood that so I think it's a right
26:16 

26:16 of passage everyone goes
26:19 

26:19 through yeah so yeah both both have
26:23 

26:23 their Frozen I think that's a very nice
26:25 

26:25 way to rap basically is understand
26:28 

26:28 depending what you're trading off you
26:30 

26:30 know when you're choosing one decision
26:32 

26:32 over the another yeah yeah yeah and like
26:35 

26:35 you know I know we went from light mode
26:36 

26:36 to dark mode and then now we're like so
26:38 

26:38 serious St but it actually like goes
26:40 

26:40 back to the same um essence of it's
26:42 

26:42 actually based on preference and what
26:44 

26:44 suits you better right but in the first
26:46 

26:46 place you have to experience both
26:47 

26:47 correct um so you it's a right of
26:49 

26:49 passage you know there doesn't have to
26:51 

26:51 be an order for it I think I heard like
26:53 

26:53 uh there was this uh first year
26:55 

26:55 university student who told me like the
26:57 

26:57 common uh conception is that you should
26:59 

26:59 start in a big company first for
27:01 

27:01 internship and then maybe do like U
27:04 

27:04 there there is no order you just have to
27:06 

27:06 experience both and see like what you
27:08 

27:08 thrive in and what your personal
27:09 

27:09 preference in is just like with light
27:11 

27:11 mode and dark mode you wouldn't know
27:12 

27:12 like which is better for you if you
27:13 

27:13 don't try both and we also don't want to
27:16 

27:16 emphasize that it's all about like this
27:18 

27:18 binary right there's always something in
27:20 

27:20 in between hybrid so like probably what
27:23 

27:23 you're experiencing or even likees so
27:26 

27:26 they already have structure and like
27:28 

27:28 still developing their teag team and all
27:30 

27:30 that so there's there's always something
27:32 

27:32 in the middle right it's whatever that
27:34 

27:34 suits you and it's actually technically
27:36 

27:36 a spectrum just in this episode we want
27:38 

27:38 to make it more like a fun debate oh
27:40 

27:40 yeah de like I love that definitely
27:43 

27:43 there's always the middle ground so it's
27:46 

27:46 really up yeah yeah yeah yeah I think we
27:48 

27:48 have time for like one more one more one
27:51 

27:51 quick and dirty so this is something we
27:53 

27:53 mentioned in uh in my episode that we
27:56 

27:56 did where I talked about full full stack
27:58 

27:58 development and how there's front end
27:60 

27:60 and back end so some people will lean
28:03 

28:03 more towards front end development and
28:05 

28:05 some people would lean more towards
28:06 

28:06 backend development so before we begin
28:09 

28:09 I'll just Define like front-end
28:11 

28:11 development would be client facing uh
28:14 

28:14 for example websites so the website that
28:17 

28:17 you see a front front end developer
28:19 

28:19 would have created uh would have
28:21 

28:21 implemented those components that you
28:23 

28:23 see on your website uh even the titles
28:27 

28:27 like the yeah the titles colors like uh
28:30 

28:30 usually front end Dev would work with a
28:33 

28:33 designer to get the the ux UI of it uh
28:38 

28:38 and versus backend developer would be
28:41 

28:41 someone who would create the databases
28:43 

28:43 the servers the backend logic to like uh
28:47 

28:47 for example if you sign in so the
28:49 

28:49 backend year would make the sign in
28:52 

28:52 portion of it and then return cookies
28:54 

28:54 and things like that to the front uh and
28:56 

28:56 save data in the database and then show
28:59 

28:59 the data back to the front end and the
29:00 

29:00 front end would show it in a nice manner
29:02 

29:02 in a list format in a table format
29:04 

29:04 things like that yeah so that's front
29:06 

29:06 end back end there are different
29:08 

29:08 languages used for different uh
29:10 

29:10 developers but yeah we I think that's
29:14 

29:14 what that's what I think that everyone
29:16 

29:16 would lean towards one you can't be Best
29:18 

29:18 of Both
29:20 

29:20 Worlds yeah or you could be best of both
29:22 

29:22 FS but not Jack of all trades thought
29:25 

29:25 Master you know so we still leaning
29:27 

29:27 towards one yeah I feel like very I I
29:30 

29:30 wouldn't um classify myself as like
29:33 

29:33 strictly front end or back end but I
29:34 

29:34 also feel very uncomfortable with the
29:36 

29:36 term full stack because yes the truth is
29:38 

29:38 I have done both front end and back end
29:40 

29:40 but what does it mean to be full stack I
29:42 

29:42 think full stack is basically somebody
29:44 

29:44 who knows both knows how to code in both
29:47 

29:47 um like like Frameworks um but at the
29:50 

29:50 same time what does knowing mean does it
29:52 

29:52 mean like you have 50% 50% confidence in
29:56 

29:56 boys I've always wondered this is really
29:58 

29:58 just open question I just really don't
29:59 

29:59 know or does it mean that I do heavy uh
30:02 

30:02 front end but I've dabbled in like some
30:05 

30:05 back end so I've always been conf
30:08 

30:08 confused by that but if you're talking
30:09 

30:09 about inclinations I think I would
30:11 

30:11 incline more front end um as in terms of
30:14 

30:14 like the actual work that I've done in
30:16 

30:16 front end but I also really love the
30:19 

30:19 process of Designing like uh the uh like
30:22 

30:22 the
30:23 

30:23 databases but in terms of the actual
30:25 

30:25 work that I've done in that I think
30:27 

30:27 comparatively time spent um there there
30:30 

30:30 is an imbalance there but it's very hard
30:31 

30:31 for me to part one or other I enjoy uh
30:34 

30:34 both processes and I think it activates
30:36 

30:36 like different parts of my brain yeah
30:39 

30:39 yeah but that's for me so but if you
30:41 

30:41 know I were had to say what I I would
30:43 

30:43 just like okay fine front end I guess
30:45 

30:45 yeah but for you like uh so I like I
30:48 

30:48 mentioned like I do call myself full St
30:50 

30:50 developer it's because I I say that for
30:53 

30:53 myself because I have done front end
30:56 

30:56 development quite a bit and I've done
30:58 

30:58 backend development quite a bit
30:60 

30:60 currently I'm doing more backend
31:02 

31:02 development so like currently currently
31:04 

31:04 I am leaning on backend more but uh if
31:08 

31:08 you ever do put me in like a reactjs
31:11 

31:11 front end project I will be able to
31:14 

31:14 catch on pretty quickly maybe I'm not up
31:17 

31:17 to date with like the latest react
31:19 

31:19 version and its uh nuances but I get I
31:23 

31:23 mean I would be able to understand it if
31:25 

31:25 given some time with Google access right
31:28 

31:28 uh so I would I would call that full
31:31 

31:31 stack but then also knowing that I do
31:34 

31:34 lean towards backend cuz that's where
31:36 

31:36 I'm more comfortable in right
31:38 

31:38 now I do like your definition of a full
31:41 

31:41 stack because it's about code
31:42 

31:42 comprehension right so if you can
31:44 

31:44 comprehend both sides that kind of means
31:47 

31:47 that you have the skills to understand
31:49 

31:49 like oh the logic how both sides work
31:52 

31:52 corre so that's kind of a good
31:54 

31:54 definition what full stack means I
31:56 

31:56 always find it also it's very hard to be
31:58 

31:58 an expert at both things that's why you
32:00 

32:00 also mention how you tend to Incline to
32:03 

32:03 one because it's so hard it's not like
32:04 

32:04 you can monitor yourself that you do
32:07 

32:07 things equally right 50/50 of the time
32:09 

32:09 and that was the same for me when I was
32:11 

32:11 starting my journey in software
32:13 

32:13 engineering I started with front end
32:16 

32:16 just cuz it's visual it's easier for me
32:18 

32:18 to see and understand and I received
32:21 

32:21 this question are you a front end or
32:23 

32:23 back end from my readers a lot and if
32:26 

32:26 you notice in my blog I I write a lot of
32:29 

32:29 um front end like react because it's
32:33 

32:33 just easier to show like in my have
32:36 

32:36 something to show yeah like I would like
32:38 

32:38 show them oh this is how you implement
32:40 

32:40 like a you know scroll element there I
32:43 

32:43 have a nice demo for you to see like
32:45 

32:45 visually but if you're talking about
32:48 

32:48 interest or like what I actually might
32:52 

32:52 like I would enjoy back end more just
32:53 

32:53 because when I'm really sitting down and
32:55 

32:55 coding and get into the flow State like
32:58 

32:58 back end just seems so wow rewarding
33:02 

33:02 like it activates a different part of my
33:04 

33:04 brain yeah yeah that I would be like I
33:06 

33:06 would find it so I I would find it
33:08 

33:08 joyful almost like when I code like
33:11 

33:11 after a backend session versus front end
33:14 

33:14 sometimes I'll be like it triggers my
33:16 

33:16 perfectionism for front end CU I'll be
33:18 

33:18 like the fing not enough I feel like I
33:20 

33:20 waste of first time in front end with
33:23 

33:23 very little reward yeah but that that's
33:26 

33:26 also a fun part of the process
33:29 

33:29 of brain ande for the te folks there I
33:34 

33:34 wanted to draw comparison uh in in this
33:36 

33:36 like whole front end and back end thing
33:38 

33:38 but it's kind of like um I don't know
33:40 

33:40 say like cooking um cooking there's two
33:43 

33:43 parts of the process the actual like uh
33:45 

33:45 you prepare the ingredients part of it
33:47 

33:47 and then you cook and plate it so I
33:49 

33:49 would say like the preparing ingredients
33:51 

33:51 part of it where you chop and your Dy
33:52 

33:52 and stuff like that um it's kind of like
33:54 

33:54 backend it's the Unseen part that's not
33:56 

33:56 what people eat eating the food would
33:59 

33:59 instinctively know when they see um the
34:01 

34:01 food um but then uh front end is kind of
34:05 

34:05 like the um plating part of the process
34:07 

34:07 where you arrange the cooked items
34:09 

34:09 already out there and that's what the
34:11 

34:11 client the user sees but if you were to
34:14 

34:14 ask the chef like which part of the
34:16 

34:16 process do you prefer he'll just look at
34:19 

34:19 you like what do you what do you mean
34:20 

34:20 it's all part of the same process but I
34:22 

34:22 think you know in a very organized
34:24 

34:24 kitchen not that I've like been in like
34:25 

34:25 an organized kitchen before I I assume
34:27 

34:27 that this role is divided into two um
34:30 

34:30 because it's just more efficient so a
34:32 

34:32 person would naturally like do one thing
34:34 

34:34 more than another because of the
34:36 

34:36 division of labor but it's not so much
34:38 

34:38 of like do they have a preference yeah
34:41 

34:41 because it's like it's part of the whole
34:43 

34:43 process so that's kind of how I see this
34:46 

34:46 whole thing and I I love what both of
34:48 

34:48 you have kind of brought out um that
34:50 

34:50 it's about quote comprehension actually
34:52 

34:52 now that you think about like yeah
34:53 

34:53 actually the fact that you can
34:55 

34:55 comprehend both like the preparing of of
34:57 

34:57 the ingredients and then like the
34:58 

34:58 presenting why it's important to the
34:60 

34:60 whole process you know and like it's
35:03 

35:03 also dependent on the current role that
35:05 

35:05 you're in you know if you happen to be
35:07 

35:07 doing more back and heavy stuff I guess
35:09 

35:09 like for now I will identify as a back
35:10 

35:10 and developer um but at the end of the
35:13 

35:13 day it is a preference and it is a
35:16 

35:16 circumstance of your external factors
35:19 

35:19 right now um it's actually part of the
35:21 

35:21 same process so yeah so whichever one
35:24 

35:24 you're more inclined to just enjoy the
35:26 

35:26 process just enjoy the process yeah just
35:29 

35:29 have fun right have fun yeah so I I
35:32 

35:32 think a lot of people they might get
35:33 

35:33 stressed out about it right like let's
35:36 

35:36 say there has been situations I've heard
35:38 

35:38 from um acquaintances where they're from
35:42 

35:42 a backend role and then they're forced
35:44 

35:44 to do front end stuff it happens a lot
35:47 

35:47 yeah and they end up not enjoying it at
35:50 

35:50 all but if you tell them like oh there's
35:52 

35:52 some things to enjoy in front end like
35:55 

35:55 they will actually slowly Discover it
35:57 

35:57 over time it just takes some time for
35:59 

35:59 different people but there's always
36:01 

36:01 something like if you have an open mind
36:03 

36:03 and like you you say like oh there's
36:05 

36:05 things that I can enjoy in both
36:06 

36:06 processes you know you'll eventually
36:09 

36:09 find something that you can like but of
36:11 

36:11 course maybe you there's a preference
36:14 

36:14 there but you can still find something
36:15 

36:15 basically so at the end of the day you
36:18 

36:18 know it doesn't matter what you are yeah
36:20 

36:20 you know I was think like at the end day
36:22 

36:22 it's still just coding it's you're still
36:25 

36:25 solving some issues some some problem
36:28 

36:28 loal problem yeah uh and and I I
36:32 

36:32 actually find it like hard to be good at
36:35 

36:35 both at the same time because there's
36:37 

36:37 like uh advancements happening in the
36:39 

36:39 backend world where you know there's a
36:40 

36:40 new database There's A New Concept to
36:42 

36:42 understand there a new way of
36:44 

36:44 architecting your back end and then on
36:46 

36:46 the front end there's a new library a
36:48 

36:48 new framework with it's oh now the new
36:51 

36:51 framework comes with new things where
36:53 

36:53 which you can use to do things even
36:54 

36:54 quicker even shorter lines of code so to
36:57 

36:57 be up to dat with both of it so I
36:59 

36:59 personally prefer to stay on one side
37:03 

37:03 just just that because it is big enough
37:06 

37:06 in itself already exactly so yeah that
37:10 

37:10 that's what it is but some people can do
37:11 

37:11 both I know of some really good full
37:14 

37:14 stack developers who are like able to
37:15 

37:15 provide input here and in the back end
37:18 

37:18 as well so yeah there are uh all all
37:22 

37:22 different kinds of people everywhere all
37:23 

37:23 kinds of chefs exactly all kinds of
37:26 

37:26 chefs chefs
37:27 

37:27 Co if anything like I know we have had
37:30 

37:30 like three sort of like major myths sort
37:33 

37:33 of debates kind of debunk but it wasn't
37:36 

37:36 really a debunking it was really like
37:38 

37:38 showing that these things you there are
37:40 

37:40 stereotypes attached to each but at the
37:42 

37:42 end of the day it's down to preference
37:44 

37:44 there is no right or wrong answer uh for
37:47 

37:47 anything um and um even in the tech
37:50 

37:50 industry uh nobody inclines to one more
37:53 

37:53 than another you might see it displayed
37:55 

37:55 in popular media in a certain in a way a
37:58 

37:58 majority of the time but you you know
38:01 

38:01 every developer is different every
38:02 

38:02 engineer is different every person in a
38:04 

38:04 tech industry is different so that's
38:06 

38:06 what I've come to realize from this
38:07 

38:07 conversation and um yeah I really
38:11 

38:11 enjoyed that conversation I like how we
38:13 

38:13 went from like super fun and bantery to
38:16 

38:16 like really serious
38:18 

38:18 like I mean technically they're all just
38:20 

38:20 fun topics but yeah it depends how you
38:23 

38:23 we articulate them sometimes as well
38:26 

38:26 yeah we just want to be sinere in how we
38:27 

38:27 like actually word it out cuz we don't
38:29 

38:29 want people to get the wrong
38:31 

38:31 idea it's binary or like anything like
38:34 

38:34 that yeah that's why sometimes we we get
38:37 

38:37 serious and it's also because we're
38:38 

38:38 passionate in talking about this so
38:40 

38:40 that's why so hope hope everyone uh
38:43 

38:43 benefited from this episode and do
38:46 

38:46 subscribe to us follow us and do all the
38:48 

38:48 socials comment on our on our episodes

38:51 to let us know what else you would like
38:52 

38:52 us to talk about or if you have some
38:54 

38:54 opinion that we would we would be
38:56 

38:56 interested to know about regarding these
38:58 

38:58 three topics that we talked about today
39:01 

39:01 and yep thank you this is R Tech yay bye
39:06 

39:06 bye
