00:00 putting 100% focus on this one thing
00:05 

00:05 yeah I'm recalling the part where I was
00:07 

00:07 manually labeling the data I know that's
00:10 

00:10 insane like like certain company heatons
00:12 

00:12 where people are forced to be there and
00:15 

00:15 you can feel it it's like yeah see
00:17 

00:17 that's why okay how I find heatons right
00:20 

00:20 cuz people say where do I look for
00:23 

00:23 [Music]
00:25 

00:25 heatons yeah I kind of like to call it
00:28 

00:28 limit testing cuz in a way you're
00:30 

00:30 testing your limits how far you can go
00:33 

00:33 in that short amount limit testing yeah
00:35 

00:35 cuz I definitely limit test how much I
00:37 

00:37 can go without sleep
00:40 

00:40 that girl now I go limit test yeah but I
00:44 

00:44 limit test also my capabilities in a
00:47 

00:47 short amount of time how fast can I
00:48 

00:48 learn a new technology and implement it
00:50 

00:50 directly into an app or something or use
00:53 

00:53 a certain like following requirements
00:55 

00:55 from a company and like how do I
00:57 

00:57 actually hit all these user stories you
00:59 

00:59 know in a short amount of time time I
01:01 

01:01 think that is part of the limit testing
01:03 

01:03 another limit testing is communication
01:05 

01:05 skills because and you work in a team
01:06 

01:06 for the first time like you never meet
01:09 

01:09 these people before you don't know their
01:10 

01:10 work style you don't know their
01:11 

01:11 communication style how far can how much
01:14 

01:14 can you achieve with new group of people
01:16 

01:16 within a short amount of time that also
01:18 

01:18 tests how good you are at communicating
01:20 

01:20 yourself how good you are at leadership
01:23 

01:23 like you know putting your points across
01:24 

01:24 and organizing people priorities task
01:28 

01:28 and all that so these are all part of
01:31 

01:31 what I call limit testing you know cuz
01:33 

01:33 I'm testing my limit and see how much
01:35 

01:35 potential there is and then the next
01:37 

01:37 Heaton I will look back in my previous
01:39 

01:39 hecaton what went wrong what I can
01:42 

01:42 improve on next time and then I'll
01:43 

01:43 reiterate that so in a way it's kind of
01:46 

01:46 like constant learning for me that
01:48 

01:48 that's what I like about hecaton uh but
01:51 

01:51 now that we have discussed about you
01:52 

01:52 know the pros of being in heatons maybe
01:55 

01:55 we can talk about the other side of the
01:57 

01:57 spectrum why would someone not join on
02:01 

02:01 or like why why basically like is there
02:04 

02:04 a another side to that discussion
02:07 

02:07 actually so you can understand is
02:08 

02:08 because you haven't been participating
02:09 

02:09 in hackathons for a while why
02:13 

02:13 why um so one thing is that you have to
02:17 

02:17 be ready for the the time commitment
02:21 

02:21 right so like 48 hours you're actually
02:23 

02:23 giving you have to probably give the
02:25 

02:25 whole 48 hours to just the hecaton so
02:29 

02:29 taking out that much time like even 7
02:31 

02:31 days it it it is a little bit stressful
02:34 

02:34 that you know I mean if you want to
02:36 

02:36 commit to it you'll have to give time to
02:38 

02:38 it so one thing would be time commitment
02:42 

02:42 second uh I feel like like at least it
02:45 

02:45 happened to me where we would form a
02:47 

02:47 team with like strangers and first day
02:50 

02:50 everyone's like super enthusiastic yes
02:52 

02:52 we're going to do this you do this do
02:54 

02:54 this and then the next day they
02:56 

02:56 disappear right so that could happen and
02:58 

02:58 that's when you know then you'll have to
03:00 

03:00 pick up the slack and work on things and
03:04 

03:04 like or try to understand or there might
03:05 

03:05 be some conflict because again you don't
03:07 

03:07 know the communication St you might hurt
03:10 

03:10 the person or step on the person or the
03:12 

03:12 other person steps on you so there'll be
03:14 

03:14 communication issues happening there
03:17 

03:17 that that you'll be like you know what
03:19 

03:19 this this not worth it I'll just leave
03:21 

03:21 as well or I'll stay I'll do a lot of
03:23 

03:23 more things so there that's those kind
03:25 

03:25 of issues uh third would
03:29 

03:29 be I okay I'll I'll tell you when I can
03:32 

03:32 think of it so just there only three
03:34 

03:34 things don't worry about three is a good
03:36 

03:36 number that's why yeah so yeah those are
03:40 

03:40 the kind of reasons right now actually
03:42 

03:42 that I'm not but uh I I and not that you
03:46 

03:46 have like you know put it out there
03:48 

03:48 maybe if I see one that is fitting into
03:51 

03:51 like my schedule yeah and your ideas if
03:54 

03:54 it's you know a good place to like
03:55 

03:55 showcase your ideas yeah you might you
03:58 

03:58 know yeah and also if you're looking for
04:00 

04:00 like team members to work on the idea
04:02 

04:02 you might also yeah so I can imagine I
04:05 

04:05 think I'm also in the same space I
04:06 

04:06 cannot see myself like participating in
04:08 

04:08 a hackathon like for this year at least
04:11 

04:11 like um cuz I'm already feeling a lot of
04:13 

04:13 burnout from like work and like other
04:15 

04:15 stuff so again because of the time
04:17 

04:17 commitment because of the intensity
04:18 

04:18 you're you're basically like putting
04:20 

04:20 100% focus on this one thing yeah oh I
04:25 

04:25 I'm recalling the part where I was
04:26 

04:26 manually labeling the data I know that's
04:29 

04:29 insane like how many you you basically
04:31 

04:31 have to put like 26 hours out 24 hours
04:33 

04:33 every day that's why you would like rate
04:35 

04:35 limiting I mean uh limit limit testing
04:37 

04:37 your sleep right probably because of
04:39 

04:39 this it's a huge time commitment but it
04:42 

04:42 is very very rewarding in a short amount
04:44 

04:44 of time it's just more of like um you do
04:47 

04:47 have to like be note the burnout that
04:50 

04:50 might happen after du to take into like
04:52 

04:52 account your commitment levels for other
04:54 

04:54 things at that point and whether you're
04:55 

04:55 mentally ready to go into like a very
04:57 

04:57 like intensive um boot Camp kind of
05:00 

05:00 environment you know um but if you do
05:04 

05:04 have like the mental capacity you know
05:06 

05:06 like we would encourage like people to
05:08 

05:08 join especially you know you haven't
05:10 

05:10 especially if you haven't joined one
05:11 

05:11 before and you're trying to understand
05:14 

05:14 um like what it's like yeah definitely
05:16 

05:16 take the plunge when you have that
05:17 

05:17 mental capacity to do so for reasons for
05:19 

05:19 such as like you know meeting new people
05:22 

05:22 testing out your own sort of ideas um or
05:25 

05:25 just like trying to understand like more
05:27 

05:27 of the tech World in general and pick up
05:29 

05:29 some new skills pick up new skills too
05:31 

05:31 yeah Victoria would highly recommend it
05:34 

05:34 yeah so I think and if you need
05:37 

05:37 recommendations she's a really good
05:38 

05:38 person to go through hackathon Queen at
05:40 

05:40 this point yeah so actually maybe that
05:43 

05:43 sex way Segway to this is that um how I
05:46 

05:46 find heatons right cuz people say where
05:48 

05:48 do I look for heatons so I went to this
05:50 

05:50 website called defpost tocom yeah so
05:54 

05:54 actually maybe we'll link it in the
05:55 

05:55 video description because death post.com
05:58 

05:58 they will always have hackathons ready
05:59 

05:59 for you for you to like see and
06:01 

06:01 participate they even have ones that
06:02 

06:02 they'll say upcoming so you can prepare
06:05 

06:05 ahead of time what you need to learn so
06:07 

06:07 let's say upcoming Heaton is about this
06:09 

06:09 AI tool that you have to integrate then
06:11 

06:11 you can study up beforehand but you must
06:13 

06:13 not build a project yet so only when the
06:15 

06:15 heon starts then you build the project
06:17 

06:17 so there's a lot of these heatons on
06:19 

06:19 deos.com and you can get like mini
06:21 

06:21 Awards and all that like yeah the
06:23 

06:23 monetary reward we didn't talk about
06:24 

06:24 that yeah some of them can like be be
06:26 

06:26 really like large rewards as well I
06:29 

06:29 think but then you had to split it
06:30 

06:30 amongst the team that's when you become
06:32 

06:32 smaller but but that's okay yeah I I won
06:34 

06:34 like a few but so you get like it's nice
06:37 

06:37 you get $200 $5 yeah definitely but I
06:40 

06:40 don't want people to go in just for the
06:44 

06:44 for sure external motivation of the
06:46 

06:46 money because at the end of the day it
06:48 

06:48 is about I think the soft rewards are
06:51 

06:51 more rewarding right like being able to
06:54 

06:54 learn and meet new people I think that
06:56 

06:56 is like the main part so going back to
06:59 

06:59 salon's point and your point about like
07:01 

07:01 why would someone not join hackathons uh
07:04 

07:04 in my perspective I agree with you guys
07:07 

07:07 about the mental capacity and time
07:08 

07:08 commitment uh another thing I would like
07:10 

07:10 to add is about having no goals so let's
07:13 

07:13 say you don't have a goal joining a
07:15 

07:15 hackathon right then it's hard to
07:17 

07:17 reflect on what you get out of it like
07:19 

07:19 some people they would go in kind of LW
07:20 

07:20 say like oh I'll figure out what to do
07:22 

07:22 when I'm there but then in the end they
07:24 

07:24 just hang around stick around and like
07:25 

07:25 just stick on the wall and not
07:26 

07:26 connecting with people or anything I'm
07:28 

07:28 talking about physical heatons so so
07:31 

07:31 they'll be like in the end it's it's
07:33 

07:33 just an event they they go to and then
07:35 

07:35 they get out without taking away much
07:38 

07:38 like maybe the only thing they took away
07:40 

07:40 is oh so this is what it looks like a
07:42 

07:42 hecaton but I would prefer if like you
07:45 

07:45 go in a hecaton you have a goal like is
07:47 

07:47 it to connect with people cuz some
07:49 

07:49 people they you don't have to build a
07:50 

07:50 project at the end of the Heaton some
07:52 

07:52 people they just go in solely to meet
07:54 

07:54 new people that's also fine so if that's
07:56 

07:56 your goal then that's also something you
07:58 

07:58 can do right let's say you own a startup
08:00 

08:00 and you want to like you know find some
08:02 

08:02 people that you know potentially you can
08:04 

08:04 hire in your team or something that's
08:06 

08:06 also something that is you know Common
08:08 

08:08 goals for hecaton so basically that's
08:11 

08:11 what I kind of encourag like you should
08:13 

08:13 have a goal going into there like
08:14 

08:14 certain company heatons where people are
08:16 

08:16 forced to be there and you can feel it
08:20 

08:20 it's like yeah see that's why okay
08:22 

08:22 before we move on to talk more about
08:24 

08:24 heatons we would like to introduce you
08:26 

08:26 to an upcoming hecaton hex Singapore hex
08:29 

08:29 Singapore is part of the global Heaton
08:31 

08:31 series by Angel heck it takes place on
08:33 

08:33 25 and 26 May 2024 it's a 24-hour
08:37 

08:37 in-person overnight hackathon and there
08:39 

08:39 will be non-stop Innovation learning and
08:42 

08:42 networking this year's themes are
08:45 

08:45 Financial inclusion social
08:47 

08:47 responsibility digital empowerment
08:50 

08:50 prizes worth up to
08:52 

08:52 $180,000 to be won so do register on
08:55 

08:55 their website and see you there oh my
08:57 

08:57 gosh internal company hackathons do not
08:59 

08:59 get me on that yeah but you you have
09:01 

09:01 that uh I had it in like my previous
09:04 

09:04 companies and we were just like so
09:07 

09:07 besides working my 9 to5 and now also
09:09 

09:09 have to work uh 6 to9 again honestly I
09:12 

09:12 do not like the idea that because of
09:14 

09:14 that because I'm paid for that job I
09:16 

09:16 feel like it's a very sorry I'm sorry to
09:18 

09:18 company secur this but like it's a very
09:20 

09:20 lazy uh way of like trying to solicit
09:23 

09:23 ideas within your company instead of
09:25 

09:25 actually paying somebody dedicated to
09:27 

09:27 solve this problem um because you're not
09:30 

09:30 like paying people extra for it either
09:33 

09:33 um but okay that's a I feel like that's
09:35 

09:35 going to be like I might get cancelled
09:36 

09:36 with I just don't do well with like
09:39 

09:39 company based like internal hackathons
09:43 

09:43 yeah you you need that problem solv go
09:45 

09:45 hire somebody to actually do build a
09:46 

09:46 proper team rather than like or don't
09:49 

09:49 expect like a deliverable at the end of
09:51 

09:51 it like maybe just get ideas out maybe
09:54 

09:54 cuz people have jobs yeah and you're not
09:57 

09:57 getting overtime paid for that yeah
09:59 

09:59 unless okay but a good idea would be to
10:01 

10:01 pay people over time for their ideas you
10:02 

10:02 know reward people for that yeah yeah
10:04 

10:04 maybe some company have internal heatons
10:06 

10:06 where they will get rewarded you know
10:08 

10:08 for for those things yeah but so that's
10:10 

10:10 why it depends on an individual if let's
10:12 

10:12 say this individual is super passionate
10:14 

10:14 about solving their company's problem
10:16 

10:16 then it's really good for them it
10:18 

10:18 motivates them maybe like it helps them
10:20 

10:20 you know some distance from their
10:22 

10:22 current job and then they can take some
10:24 

10:24 time off to work on the Heaton and if
10:26 

10:26 the managers allow them to do that then
10:28 

10:28 that's also a good thing so I would say
10:30 

10:30 use case depends from one person to
10:33 

10:33 another yeah we don't want to say like
10:35 

10:35 you know it's completely bad or anything
10:36 

10:36 exactly I mean the TD is that like like
10:39 

10:39 we said it takes a lot of mental
10:40 

10:40 capacity and time to like generate ideas
10:43 

10:43 in such a small amount of time and
10:45 

10:45 develop prototypes for it so um because
10:47 

10:47 of that you know if you're participating
10:49 

10:49 in external hackathons um uh like that's
10:52 

10:52 why you have to make sure you're in a
10:53 

10:53 good mental space to do that it's a lot
10:55 

10:55 of commitment and for company wise I'm
10:58 

10:58 not saying like don't do it but ackn
10:60 

10:60 that you know I these are hard things to
11:02 

11:02 come by you would pay like an actual
11:04 

11:04 individual outside like consultancies or
11:06 

11:06 something to do this job so make sure
11:08 

11:08 you reward your people and acknowledge
11:10 

11:10 the effort put in and don't just take it
11:12 

11:12 for granted that people you know it's
11:14 

11:14 not easy to come out with ideas it's
11:16 

11:16 even harder to like materialize those
11:18 

11:18 ideas so yeah basically yeah so I think
11:24 

11:24 we can move on to about like hecaton
11:26 

11:26 like let's say someone is a new very new
11:28 

11:28 in hecaton right and they're scared to
11:29 

11:29 to like ATT 10 one like what are some
11:32 

11:32 hackathon tips because I think the first
11:34 

11:34 thing I struggle with when I join a
11:35 

11:35 hackathon is forming a team because I
11:38 

11:38 don't know anyone right I don't know
11:40 

11:40 what they do and like you have to form a
11:42 

11:42 team like in a really short amount of
11:43 

11:43 time and suddenly you see like all
11:45 

11:45 around the room everyone already team up
11:47 

11:47 and then you're like oh yeah you know
11:48 

11:48 why they team up they come as a team
11:50 

11:50 right so that's so that was my going to
11:52 

11:52 be my advice like I used to go with my
11:55 

11:55 friend yeah so like a different friend
11:57 

11:57 so even like it was her first time as
11:59 

11:59 well so I bring my second time so I'll
12:01 

12:01 be like no you should come you should
12:03 

12:03 like see how it is so then at least I'm
12:05 

12:05 together with her usually be in a team
12:07 

12:07 with her and a few other people so at
12:09 

12:09 least if nothing else I have a partner
12:12 

12:12 there already that's a good strategy so
12:14 

12:14 I usually go in pairs or like if you
12:16 

12:16 already have like a full form team go
12:18 

12:18 ahead that's even better yeah but if
12:20 

12:20 your goal is that you know you currently
12:22 

12:22 don't have people that you can connect
12:24 

12:24 with and your goal going into the
12:25 

12:25 hackathon is to meet new people then the
12:28 

12:28 strategy would be to like on the onset
12:31 

12:31 of that hackathon to just kind of like
12:33 

12:33 put yourself out there to talk to one
12:35 

12:35 person at least like just make that your
12:37 

12:37 goal I want to talk to one person that
12:40 

12:40 person will likely have the same goal
12:42 

12:42 you see so if you reach out to them
12:44 

12:44 first you both would have fulfilled that
12:46 

12:46 goal and now you have like you don't
12:47 

12:47 have to bring like that pair buddy you
12:49 

12:49 just meet one so I would say that that's
12:51 

12:51 the next strategy like half The Upfront
12:54 

12:54 like confidence investment to just reach
12:56 

12:56 out to somebody talk because 95% of the
12:60 

12:60 time they are in the same spot and
13:01 

13:01 they're just like I just need to talk to
13:03 

13:03 someone yeah yeah yeah and definitely
13:06 

13:06 and another thing was that uh usually
13:08 

13:08 these heatons have a theme around it
13:09 

13:09 right so like I went for one which was
13:11 

13:11 Ed teched education uh technology stuff
13:16 

13:16 and there's one for like uh Green living
13:20 

13:20 or something so only go for it if you're
13:23 

13:23 interested in that topic or in that team
13:25 

13:25 cuz you should have some background
13:28 

13:28 about what that space is and then you
13:31 

13:31 can find problems or solution and see if
13:33 

13:33 the solution even works out for that
13:35 

13:35 problem space you can talk about things
13:37 

13:37 if the theme matches with your uh with
13:41 

13:41 yourself so that's another thing go for
13:43 

13:43 familiar or interested topics yeah yeah
13:46 

13:46 interested is important because some
13:48 

13:48 people they go in with the intention to
13:50 

13:50 learn so they might not be familiar yet
13:53 

13:53 but they want to learn from other people
13:55 

13:55 so interested you know you'll find
13:58 

13:58 people who have around the same interest
13:60 

14:00 as you right like like for me I went to
14:02 

14:02 a game development one oh yeah of course
14:05 

14:05 you did and of course I meet other game
14:08 

14:08 developers from there so then I learned
14:10 

14:10 about other game technologies that I can
14:12 

14:12 use for my future games and I was like
14:14 

14:14 oh this is so cool you know so it's
14:17 

14:17 always about you know enhancing yourself
14:19 

14:19 your interest and even widening your
14:21 

14:21 scope of Interest by you know just
14:24 

14:24 exploring like your curious Fields
14:27 

14:27 interests and all that that's I think
14:30 

14:30 what makes Heaton such an enjoyable
14:32 

14:32 experience um I would say like like you
14:37 

14:37 guys mentioned it really depends on what
14:40 

14:40 you're looking for and like whether you
14:42 

14:42 have the mental capacity to do it but at
14:45 

14:45 the end of the day um you should just do
14:48 

14:48 it yeah it will it will always be
14:50 

14:50 rewarding yeah so just know that the
14:53 

14:53 investment has returns you know yeah but
14:55 

14:55 it's just like also make sure that you
14:57 

14:57 are in the right space to make that
14:59 

14:59 investment in the first place so you
14:60 

14:60 don't burn out yeah and whether you win
15:02 

15:02 or not there's something that you take
15:04 

15:04 away from that so a lot of people
15:06 

15:06 they'll be like oh I lost so I got
15:08 

15:08 discouraged I see a lot of people who
15:10 

15:10 are actually really discouraged because
15:11 

15:11 they see the whole thing as like my
15:13 

15:13 entire idea just got like invalidated
15:16 

15:16 but that's not the case yeah it's about
15:18 

15:18 like what like what you say what you
15:19 

15:19 take away Beyond like the tangible
15:21 

15:21 rewards it's the journey it's that whole
15:23 

15:23 practice and exercise of like knowing
15:25 

15:25 what it takes to like pit your idea and
15:27 

15:27 how to iterate on it and at least you
15:29 

15:29 know now now that your idea does not
15:31 

15:31 really you know work out or help in this
15:33 

15:33 kind of problem statement at least you
15:35 

15:35 know it earlier imagine you have built
15:37 

15:37 like a ffled app for it and then get
15:39 

15:39 rejected later so in a way you know
15:42 

15:42 sometimes shortterm pain is better than
15:45 

15:45 the long term you know no pain no gain
15:48 

15:48 oh yeah no pain no that's also I was
15:50 

15:50 thinking there was a Chinese proverb
15:51 

15:51 where it's like a Chinese proverb yeah
15:53 

15:53 short-term pain like short-term Shar
15:55 

15:55 pain you want to say it in Chinese no I
15:57 

15:57 forgot in Chinese I translated it Google
16:02 

16:02 translate but yeah I think all in all I
16:04 

16:04 think we can allize that like uh heatons
16:07 

16:07 are really beneficial there are a lot of
16:09 

16:09 benefits be it like meeting new people
16:11 

16:11 learning how to validate an idea putting
16:13 

16:13 yourself out there to learn presentation
16:15 

16:15 skills um and and many more rewards that
16:18 

16:18 are beyond the actual like tangible
16:19 

16:19 $2,000 like reward kind of thing um it's
16:22 

16:22 about the journey learning uh new things
16:24 

16:24 meeting new people um but at the same
16:27 

16:27 time we want to put it out there that
16:28 

16:28 definitely they do take a lot of mental
16:30 

16:30 capacity they do take a lot of time so
16:32 

16:32 do make sure that you have are in the
16:34 

16:34 right time and space to do one uh
16:36 

16:36 instead of thinking that yeah I am obled
16:38 

16:38 should like go hackathon after hackathon
16:40 

16:40 in order to prove myself as a good
16:42 

16:42 developer or something like yeah don't
16:43 

16:43 do that if you burn out that's even
16:45 

16:45 worse um but beyond that like um
16:48

16:49
