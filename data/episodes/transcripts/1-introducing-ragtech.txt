00:00 I first uh like got into computer
00:02 

00:02 science like in uni the first thing I
00:05 

00:05 asked my mom and dad was like do you
00:07 

00:07 think I would be able to fix the light
00:08 

00:08 bulb after my uni definitely the fomo
00:10 

00:10 thing is real just because I'm I was
00:13 

00:13 active in Tech Twitter everything else
00:14 

00:14 is not true right like wearing a
00:17 

00:17 hoodie don't talk about like things in
00:21 

00:21 great technical detail like public
00:23 

00:23 static white m r semicolon yeah we don't
00:28 

00:28 talk about that I did not know that
00:31 

00:31 Robotics and software like come together
00:33 

00:33 I mean you need that software to operate
00:35 

00:35 the robot
00:36 

00:36 [Music]
00:39 

00:39 yeah hi there we're rag Tech we're a
00:41 

00:41 group of friends in Tech who decided to
00:43 

00:43 make a podcast to talk about the
00:44 

00:44 realities in Tech and the most casual
00:46 

00:46 least techy way possible in our rack
00:49 

00:49 teac team we have Saloni a software
00:51 

00:51 engineer Victoria a Solutions engineer
00:53 

00:53 and Natasha a software engineer together
00:56 

00:56 we're the friends who form R Tech where
00:58 

00:58 we indulge in bites and benter in our
01:00 

01:00 first episode we wanted to quickly chat
01:02 

01:02 about how the idea for rec Tech started
01:05 

01:05 and also briefly chat about the various
01:06 

01:06 topics on the realities behind Tech we
01:08 

01:08 wanted to explore more in our podcasts
01:10 

01:10 it's our first episode so we're just
01:12 

01:12 starting to learn the ropes so be sure
01:14 

01:14 to like And subscribe and leave comments
01:16 

01:16 Below on how we can improve and what you
01:17 

01:17 would like us to chat about so now on to
01:20 

01:20 our first episode introducing rect Tech
01:23 

01:23 but I think at the end of the day we
01:24 

01:24 just wanted like a platform that we all
01:26 

01:26 the three of us can share and then we
01:28 

01:28 just want to be able to talk about our
01:30 

01:30 perspectives in Tech our experiences
01:33 

01:33 because they're diverse you know that's
01:34 

01:34 why I re Tech yeah so our diverse
01:36 

01:36 experience in Tech as well as like being
01:38 

01:38 able to connect with other people so
01:41 

01:41 using our platform to actually connect
01:43 

01:43 with other people and interview them and
01:45 

01:45 learn about their perspectives so in a
01:48 

01:48 way we want this to be a more casual
01:50 

01:50 light-hearted way for us to like bring
01:53 

01:53 the realities of tech to the general
01:56 

01:56 public you know yeah yeah I think we
01:58 

01:58 were talking a lot about like how um the
02:00 

02:00 existing media about tech oh yeah she's
02:02 

02:02 right next to you the existing media
02:05 

02:05 about tech tends to be very intense very
02:07 

02:07 serious it's like it's something that I
02:09 

02:09 guess technical folks like us would go
02:11 

02:11 to when we want to learn stuff it's like
02:12 

02:12 oh how to build like a react app in like
02:14 

02:14 5 hours but that kind of intensity can
02:17 

02:17 scare a lot of like people who are still
02:19 

02:19 trying to set foot into the industry and
02:21 

02:21 even for like technical folks like
02:23 

02:23 ourselves there's also this feeling of
02:25 

02:25 like wow everybody is out there doing so
02:27 

02:27 many like serious intensely cool stuff
02:29 

02:29 and you feel like
02:30 

02:30 which was also a topic that we were
02:32 

02:32 discussing about about how it's okay to
02:35 

02:35 be an average Joe in Tech yeah yeah
02:39 

02:39 average Jane average Jane yes yeah but
02:42 

02:42 definitely the fomo thing is real just
02:44 

02:44 because I'm I was active in Tech Twitter
02:46 

02:46 for quite a while and Tech Twitter is
02:48 

02:48 really full of like people who are new
02:50 

02:50 to Tech and they're like checking out
02:52 

02:52 new content like what kind of things I
02:53 

02:53 should learn if I want to get started
02:55 

02:55 and it's always like top 10 languages
02:57 

02:57 you have to learn by 2024 and it creates
02:60 

02:60 a lot of like this kind of competitive
03:02 

03:02 pressure for people who are starting and
03:04 

03:04 they'll think like oh in Tech it's all
03:06 

03:06 about like you know being like outdoing
03:08 

03:08 each other or like learning the most
03:10 

03:10 newest technology learning the newest
03:13 

03:13 testing uh library and all that tools
03:15 

03:15 framework that's why I'm not on Twitter
03:17 

03:17 it's like way too intense for me Twitter
03:19 

03:19 as well no I'm not yeah but I'm on
03:21 

03:21 LinkedIn and Linkedin is also the same
03:22 

03:22 thing right I just do Instagram
03:25 

03:25 scrolling so yeah I mean Instagram also
03:28 

03:28 has like a few like Tech account
03:31 

03:31 and you know you getet and it comes with
03:34 

03:34 like images which is like nice but yeah
03:36 

03:36 I think still like despite all these
03:38 

03:38 like more neutral platforms that are
03:40 

03:40 like yeah top 10 languages to learn it
03:42 

03:42 still tends to be like really intense in
03:45 

03:45 Syria so I think we realized it was kind
03:47 

03:47 of like a missing market for like
03:50 

03:50 perhaps something that looks at Tech in
03:52 

03:52 a more casual and light-hearted manner
03:54 

03:54 you know it it kind of like simulates
03:56 

03:56 the conversations that we would have
03:57 

03:57 over dinner I mean even like software
03:59 

03:59 engineers my it's like we don't talk
04:02 

04:02 about like things in great technical
04:05 

04:05 detail like public static white me with
04:09 

04:09 semicolon we don't talk about that we we
04:12 

04:12 don't go too deep deep into Tech we
04:15 

04:15 actually we do mention it we talk about
04:18 

04:18 high level Tech stuff that we working on
04:20 

04:20 maybe but yeah it's
04:22 

04:22 usually yeah I mean we rarely like go
04:25 

04:25 into detail about oh what teex stack do
04:26 

04:26 I use this is the exact teex St what I
04:28 

04:28 don't know what stack you use I
04:30 

04:30 or like how do you design your database
04:32 

04:32 like exactly tell me and like no we
04:34 

04:34 don't we are not that intense and that's
04:36 

04:36 why we're trying to kind of use this
04:38 

04:38 platform to also demystify all of that
04:40 

04:40 yeah yeah yeah so people can really see
04:43 

04:43 the realities of what it means to be a
04:46 

04:46 person in the tech industry that it's
04:48 

04:48 not all like intense that you know we
04:50 

04:50 are all like people trying to get by I
04:53 

04:53 mean the other day we were talking about
04:55 

04:55 like um what does it mean to be coding
04:58 

04:58 to be a software engineer but really
04:60 

04:60 were saying that it was basically like
05:01 

05:01 just being really good at
05:03 

05:03 Google I mean yeah like I said right
05:06 

05:06 like the difference between a 10K celery
05:08 

05:08 versus 100K celery kind of software
05:11 

05:11 Engineers really because one has more
05:13 

05:13 experience and one is just a better
05:15 

05:15 googler you know but of course in the
05:17 

05:17 future it'll be a better cheat GPT
05:19 

05:19 prompter prompter yeah yeah it's funny
05:23 

05:23 yeah yeah it definitely is a skill a
05:24 

05:24 skill yeah but I think you know even
05:26 

05:26 things that come up like it's funny that
05:28 

05:28 we were talking about like coders just
05:30 

05:30 very good googlers and we were at Google
05:32 

05:32 talking about it yeah but at the same
05:34 

05:34 time we were also talking about like how
05:36 

05:36 um as coders like when people realize
05:38 

05:38 you do code you're like so you know AI
05:41 

05:41 oh oh yes yeah yeah coding is AI nope no
05:45 

05:45 it's not it's not there are so many
05:47 

05:47 different spectrums to the tech industry
05:50 

05:50 you could be a software developer you
05:52 

05:52 could be a data scientist data analyst
05:54 

05:54 Business
05:56 

05:56 Development yeah and cyber security
05:58 

05:58 there's so many etc etc a lot of stuff
06:02 

06:02 that we don't really know yet that we're
06:03 

06:03 still trying to explore and and these
06:05 

06:05 are things that we you know in our own
06:07 

06:07 domains would never have expertise over
06:09 

06:09 or claim that we would have expertise
06:11 

06:11 over you know like even though like data
06:13 

06:13 science and AI right now it's a big
06:15 

06:15 thing and you know and while we do
06:17 

06:17 software and those are perhaps like
06:19 

06:19 services that we use like you ask us to
06:22 

06:22 build a model I'll just be like staring
06:24 

06:24 at it's a black box it's a black box
06:26 

06:26 right even Salone just mentioned how she
06:28 

06:28 went out with her data science friend
06:30 

06:30 and she talk about data sciencey stuff
06:32 

06:32 did you guys even talk about data
06:33 

06:33 science we did not talk about data
06:35 

06:35 sciencey stuff I just
06:38 

06:38 generaliz you don't know what of that's
06:41 

06:41 why yeah and also we did not talk about
06:43 

06:43 software engineering stuff so it's
06:47 

06:47 just yeah yeah I think we talk about
06:50 

06:50 like generic things uh about being in
06:53 

06:53 Tech you know you were talking about
06:55 

06:55 more like promotions and stuff like that
06:58 

06:58 it's stuff that even people in non Tech
07:00 

07:00 also talk about it's just applied in the
07:03 

07:03 context of tech and it's just that like
07:05 

07:05 um in the context of tech this can like
07:07 

07:07 look a little bit different from the uh
07:09 

07:09 from other Industries outside and those
07:11 

07:11 are things that we talk about on a day
07:13 

07:13 on day with our friends and we want the
07:15 

07:15 world to know about as well because a
07:16 

07:16 lot of like the popular media out there
07:18 

07:18 might not cover this you know it it
07:20 

07:20 probably like cover things like oh how
07:22 

07:22 much do you earn as like a software
07:23 

07:23 engineer but it's it's not the same you
07:26 

07:26 can't just like you know Proclaim that
07:28 

07:28 software Engineers like because earn
07:30 

07:30 like I don't know 10K Plus+ per month at
07:32 

07:32 Google that means like any software
07:34 

07:34 engineer job is going to earn that yeah
07:36 

07:36 those are myths that I think a lot of
07:38 

07:38 people um believe is true yeah it's also
07:42 

07:42 quite common circulating around social
07:44 

07:44 media like this is the road map to get
07:46 

07:46 into a mang job and all that right oh
07:49 

07:49 yeah so follow these exact steps and you
07:52 

07:52 will reach that dream you know yeah yeah
07:54 

07:54 at first I was mang I was like oh Fang
07:56 

07:56 and now meta like raming that kind of
07:59 

07:59 keep track the tech industry moves too
08:01 

08:01 fast it does move very very fast so um I
08:04 

08:04 know we're just talking earlier like Sal
08:06 

08:06 how you mentioned you just went off the
08:07 

08:07 grid for for two weeks yeah and I
08:10 

08:10 actually I was actually uh feeling
08:12 

08:12 anxious when I came back like oh no the
08:14 

08:14 tech industry must have moved like 10
08:15 

08:15 leaps forward in the two weeks which is
08:19 

08:19 it probably did like a few more liaries
08:21 

08:21 have come up probably in the two weeks
08:23 

08:23 but we need to know that relax it does
08:26 

08:26 not change the world you are still
08:28 

08:28 relevant and you still know how to do
08:31 

08:31 your part of the work and yeah liaries
08:33 

08:33 will be releasing everyday new languages
08:35 

08:35 coming out every day but you don't have
08:37 

08:37 to jump on every new hype yeah exactly
08:41 

08:41 yeah because if you were to jump on
08:42 

08:42 every new height right and then you
08:44 

08:44 basically I don't know on link into
08:46 

08:46 something you have like Stacks and
08:47 

08:47 stacks and stacks of like all these
08:48 

08:48 different languages but truly like what
08:50 

08:50 do you really know it's really about
08:52 

08:52 like sure you can be using this one
08:55 

08:55 stack for like the next 5 years of your
08:57 

08:57 life but really underlying it the design
09:00 

09:00 of it you know the foundational
09:02 

09:02 knowledge that you have and the use case
09:04 

09:04 we were talking a lot about the use case
09:06 

09:06 specific to your company or specific to
09:07 

09:07 that site project you're on it doesn't
09:09 

09:09 mean that because it's the newest best
09:11 

09:11 language and everybody is talking about
09:13 

09:13 it that you have to use it it's about
09:15 

09:15 measuring the pros and cons across like
09:18 

09:18 these newer Stacks versus like the
09:20 

09:20 current stack that you're using it's
09:22 

09:22 also like if your company is already
09:23 

09:23 using that stack you know a lot of
09:25 

09:25 people don't understand that you can't
09:27 

09:27 just switch from one thing to another
09:29 

09:29 overnight yeah yeah it's like a huge
09:32 

09:32 effort for a company so I think these
09:36 

09:36 are things that we really wanted to also
09:38 

09:38 talk about yeah and
09:40 

09:40 demystify definitely yeah use case is
09:43 

09:43 very important that's why I'll say a lot
09:45 

09:45 of people who like my readers who
09:47 

09:47 contacted me and asked me hey um should
09:50 

09:50 I learn you know these testing tools
09:52 

09:52 should I learn these Frameworks and I'll
09:54 

09:54 say why do you want to learn it right
09:57 

09:57 you need to have a good reason like do
09:58 

09:58 you what you want want to build
09:60 

09:60 basically right you don't just learn it
10:02 

10:02 for the sake of learning it and plus it
10:04 

10:04 will not you will not retain it if you
10:05 

10:05 don't like actually have the use case
10:07 

10:07 you know like people just learn it and
10:09 

10:09 then they'll like not use it right if
10:11 

10:11 you not if you don't use it you'll lose
10:12 

10:12 it so I always ask them these questions
10:15 

10:15 make sure that they really have a true
10:17 

10:17 reason to basically use these and so
10:21 

10:21 yeah we were just talking about earlier
10:22 

10:22 with you know graphql right like how in
10:25 

10:25 the end you didn't adopt graphql and
10:28 

10:28 that's okay right so that's the thing
10:30 

10:30 about tech like it's always changing and
10:32 

10:32 it's always evolving right but you just
10:34 

10:34 need to find like the tools that suit
10:36 

10:36 for you and it doesn't matter whether
10:38 

10:38 it's new or it's old like old can be
10:41 

10:41 it's debatable but old can also be a
10:43 

10:43 classic right it can also be something
10:46 

10:46 that you will use so it's like tried and
10:47 

10:47 tested with a good development uh tool
10:51 

10:51 developer Tools around it yeah exactly I
10:54 

10:54 mean it's just like Microsoft PowerPoint
10:57 

10:57 has been here forever you don't see
10:59 

10:59 people getting off it right people still
11:00 

11:00 list like Microsoft PowerPoint as like a
11:03 

11:03 treasured skill on LinkedIn because like
11:05 

11:05 yeah it's a tried and tested tool and
11:07 

11:07 over the years people know that it's
11:09 

11:09 good that's why they don't like migrate
11:10 

11:10 to other platforms so I think it's the
11:12 

11:12 same logic here and you know the
11:14 

11:14 pressure to want to like keep trying
11:16 

11:16 every new thing and spitting up site
11:18 

11:18 projects just to try out that new thing
11:21 

11:21 it's like oh I I did this and I used
11:23 

11:23 this St I did that and I used this stack
11:24 

11:24 I mean there's also like the going
11:26 

11:26 pressure of like thinking that you need
11:29 

11:29 to have multiple site projects outside
11:31 

11:31 your 9 to5 yeah so that is definitely
11:35 

11:35 something that we've also talked about
11:36 

11:36 about site projects how it becomes it
11:39 

11:39 feels like the norm right like everyone
11:40 

11:40 thinks oh you work 9 to5 and then 5 to9
11:43 

11:43 S project so I was of I was I was one of
11:47 

11:47 them I actually used to think even now
11:49 

11:49 sometimes I do I still have side
11:51 

11:51 projects but my main thing was that okay
11:54 

11:54 after my 95 I should be working on side
11:56 

11:56 projects because in interviews that's
11:59 

11:59 what interviewers look out for cuz there
12:01 

12:01 is there are Brazilian people who want
12:03 

12:03 to come into software development and
12:06 

12:06 it's so easy to now become a software
12:07 

12:07 developer boot camps Udi you know just
12:11 

12:11 just follow a few follow a few articles
12:14 

12:14 and videos there you are you can you can
12:17 

12:17 now start coding but how do you
12:19 

12:19 differentiate the the good passionate
12:21 

12:21 software developers from the ones who
12:23 

12:23 are just in it to you know make the big
12:25 

12:25 bucks for example so the distinguishing
12:29 

12:29 factor for me was site projects so okay
12:32 

12:32 so yeah this is your resume that's good
12:34 

12:34 but what do you do on the site so then I
12:36 

12:36 could say things like oh I actually
12:38 

12:38 built uh this to-do list for example uh
12:43 

12:43 that actually syncs between me and my
12:45 

12:45 husband and we can actually have like a
12:48 

12:48 sync to-do list and we check things off
12:50 

12:50 so that that actually sounds that like
12:52 

12:52 someone like someone who is passionate
12:55 

12:55 about coding and is now applying it to
12:58 

12:58 their real life and coding for me is not
13:00 

13:00 just my way of earning money but it's
13:03 

13:03 also my hobby my passion so I would then
13:06 

13:06 hire this person because they must be
13:08 

13:08 really good at coding and they'll do
13:10 

13:10 good for my company exactly but at the
13:12 

13:12 same time it's kind of like crazy that
13:15 

13:15 it's and like companies expect it I
13:17 

13:17 don't see like other Industries I don't
13:20 

13:20 know like accounting do you do
13:21 

13:21 accounting on a day-to-day
13:23 

13:23 outside buch of like you you don't see
13:25 

13:25 that I me anyways like it just happened
13:27 

13:27 that they asked that question you had a
13:29 

13:29 functional side project you had a
13:30 

13:30 problem like and you created like that
13:33 

13:33 app to like solve it but you didn't
13:35 

13:35 create it because you were going to
13:37 

13:37 interview because you felt like you
13:39 

13:39 needed to be part of the hustle culture
13:41 

13:41 but it it helped so then then that's why
13:43 

13:43 I started like preaching to others
13:45 

13:45 around me that oh you must have a side
13:47 

13:47 project cuz that's what people look out
13:49 

13:49 for yeah yeah I don't know I'm kind of
13:52 

13:52 on the fence on whether to encourage or
13:54 

13:54 like disc it's become like a toxic Loop
13:56 

13:56 of expectations right like people are
13:58 

13:58 expecting it from you so you end up
13:60 

13:60 doing it but it originally started
14:02 

14:02 because you really like to do it and you
14:04 

14:04 do have a problem to solve you're not
14:06 

14:06 doing it for the sake of just you know
14:08 

14:08 you just have to build your portfolio
14:10 

14:10 but these days it becomes quite
14:12 

14:12 artificial um and so um it's really
14:15 

14:15 nothing to judge like you you see
14:16 

14:16 someone with like a more grayish GitHub
14:20 

14:20 like comit
14:22 

14:22 history I I confess I haven't been you
14:25 

14:25 know my GitHub looks kind of blank but
14:27 

14:27 it's okay right like because we are
14:29 

14:29 people you know we're not like 24/7
14:32 

14:32 coding like that's also another
14:34 

14:34 definitely there that's also another
14:36 

14:36 misconception when I talk with my
14:38 

14:38 friends who are outside of the tech
14:39 

14:39 industry they think like don't you like
14:41 

14:41 like almost every day 24 hours like in
14:44 

14:44 your dark room like just coding like
14:46 

14:46 that then I'm like no in fact the dark
14:48 

14:48 room part is correct because I do like
14:50 

14:50 my dark room but but everything else is
14:53 

14:53 not true right like you're not wearing a
14:56 

14:56 hoodie they do give a lot of Hoodie
14:58 

14:58 merch though like gave me merch yeah
14:60 

15:00 yeah it's not practical in singap
15:02 

15:02 weather let's be real yeah yeah but I
15:04 

15:04 would say The Stereotype though at the
15:07 

15:07 end of the day it's not it's not that
15:08 

15:08 true yeah it's definitely not that true
15:11 

15:11 and I think like this obsession over
15:14 

15:14 like having so many side projects
15:16 

15:16 because like the demand is there like
15:19 

15:19 now the tech industry is so saturated
15:21 

15:21 because like the media also like blows
15:23 

15:23 it out how much money you can earn and
15:24 

15:24 stuff like that I mean it's kind of
15:26 

15:26 crazy you know the expectation that
15:28 

15:28 there's so many people just flooding the
15:29 

15:29 industry right now that I was like at
15:31 

15:31 this Tech Community event and I had like
15:34 

15:34 a first year university student come up
15:37 

15:37 to me and you know she was like really
15:39 

15:39 talking about like oh what do you do
15:41 

15:41 what do I do and towards the end of the
15:42 

15:42 conversation I was just like you're a
15:44 

15:44 first year university so it's great that
15:46 

15:46 you're attending all these events but
15:48 

15:48 like what are you trying to get out of
15:49 

15:49 it and then uh the person was just like
15:52 

15:52 I'm trying to get an internship I'm like
15:53 

15:53 in your first year and she's like yeah
15:56 

15:56 because you know everybody is saying
15:57 

15:57 that in my first year I have to get like
15:59 

15:59 a a man internship and then the second
16:01 

16:01 year maybe try for like a smaller
16:02 

16:02 company and then my third year this and
16:04 

16:04 a entire road map planed and then I
16:06 

16:06 stopped her and I asked her like have so
16:09 

16:09 what classes are you taking right now
16:10 

16:10 and have you actually touched code and
16:12 

16:12 she was like no I'm taking like a data
16:15 

16:15 structures and algorithms class right
16:16 

16:16 now and I'm like did you even try like
16:20 

16:20 actually coding for fun and the answer
16:22 

16:22 was no she couldn't answer me so gone in
16:25 

16:25 the days of like people coming into like
16:28 

16:28 the software engineering World coding
16:30 

16:30 world because you know they were playing
16:32 

16:32 Minecraft and trying to mod it with like
16:34 

16:34 JavaScript stuff or like for myself I
16:36 

16:36 was just like fiddling around with like
16:38 

16:38 notepad to like hold up my own program I
16:40 

16:40 mean and these are all reasons that we
16:42 

16:42 came into like uh the industry so it's
16:45 

16:45 very obvious like this is a passion yeah
16:48 

16:48 but I think like more and more people
16:49 

16:49 are coming into it because they know
16:51 

16:51 there's big money yeah yeah um and I
16:54 

16:54 think that's why because people are
16:56 

16:56 coming in thinking that I'm going to get
16:58 

16:58 big money then the demand of like
16:59 

16:59 interviewers have changed because now
17:00 

17:00 they have the question like are you
17:02 

17:02 actually passionate about this are you
17:03 

17:03 here for correct I do have um uh a
17:08 

17:08 reader of mine who have contacted me
17:10 

17:10 before saying she got so burnt out and
17:12 

17:12 overwhelmed because she was doing all
17:14 

17:14 these courses at once and attending all
17:16 

17:16 these networking events that says would
17:18 

17:18 benefit her and her future but then she
17:20 

17:20 realized that she actually don't like
17:22 

17:22 coding she just wants it because of the
17:24 

17:24 money cuz many people say this is your
17:26 

17:26 way to get into Silicon Valley and be
17:28 

17:28 dang rich and like own a big you know
17:30 

17:30 Bungalow in in the states and she was
17:33 

17:33 like yeah that was my path and now I'm
17:35 

17:35 so dang lost because I realized that I
17:38 

17:38 don't enjoy it I'm so dang burned out
17:40 

17:40 yeah so the these things happen and
17:43 

17:43 that's why we are trying to debunk all
17:45 

17:45 these right like the realities of
17:47 

17:47 software engineering and we're not like
17:48 

17:48 saying that oh you must like super duper
17:51 

17:51 like to code to be like intact like you
17:54 

17:54 can like enjoy it as a work if you don't
17:57 

17:57 enjoy it as like a a hobby you have
17:59 

17:59 other Hobbies that's also fine right
18:01 

18:01 like life is all about like balancing
18:03 

18:03 those Hobbies right so if you see your
18:06 

18:06 work which is like programming and
18:08 

18:08 designing software as a part of things
18:10 

18:10 that you enjoy that's also good like you
18:12 

18:12 can finish 9 to5 and then after 5 you
18:15 

18:15 can go swimming tennis whatever hobes
18:17 

18:17 you enjoy that's also fine like it's
18:19 

18:19 seriously um sometimes people treat uh
18:22 

18:22 think themselves like super seriously
18:24 

18:24 but I've read this in the book somewhere
18:25 

18:25 it's like someone put a quote in that
18:27 

18:27 book and then it says we're just all
18:29 

18:29 monkeys with a plan monke Co
18:33 

18:33 monkeys yeah just don't treat don't take
18:35 

18:35 ourselves so seriously B yeah exactly
18:38 

18:38 and the truth is like our like outside
18:40 

18:40 of work like we're not just doing coding
18:44 

18:44 like we have hobbies that are not
18:45 

18:45 related to code like I personally like
18:48 

18:48 climb I have cats you know doing a lot
18:50 

18:50 of Animal Welfare stuff like you know
18:52 

18:52 Foster cat right here but now adopted
18:55 

18:55 cat yeah I think you tell you play a lot
18:57 

18:57 of games it's actually games is how I
18:59 

18:59 got into coding in the first place cuz I
19:01 

19:01 built like a game with Visual Basic what
19:05 

19:05 I know I know you a game with Visual
19:08 

19:08 Basic ah seriously I I go crazy I go
19:11 

19:11 crazy I literally download like all the
19:13 

19:13 pngs of like the characters I wanted and
19:16 

19:16 that's how I even pick up Photoshop cuz
19:18 

19:18 I have to photoshop out the background
19:20 

19:20 and all that oh my gosh that's how you
19:22 

19:22 created your assive I know and then I
19:24 

19:24 start drawing in Photoshop as well like
19:26 

19:26 backgrounds and all that trees and then
19:29 

19:29 slowly I got into game development so I
19:31 

19:31 learned C right oh so you started in
19:33 

19:33 Game Dev actually actually it was just a
19:36 

19:36 hobby at that time so I was in uni and
19:38 

19:38 I'm just developing games as a hobby and
19:40 

19:40 I even like just showing off to my
19:42 

19:42 friends like look at my first platform a
19:44 

19:44 game you know but it's it's really
19:46 

19:46 something I don't Envision me myself
19:48 

19:48 doing right cuz I'm actually uh graduate
19:51 

19:51 with a finance degree so I'm I thought
19:53 

19:53 I'll be into like I'll be working in a
19:55 

19:55 bank right but then when I realized that
19:58 

19:58 I really love like building things and I
19:60 

19:60 like to like solve problems through code
20:04 

20:04 I'm like this is what I want to do yeah
20:07 

20:07 yeah so sometimes people find it later
20:09 

20:09 right in life and sometimes people find
20:11 

20:11 it you know immediately and that's okay
20:14 

20:14 as well yeah yeah exactly like for
20:16 

20:16 yourself did you you graduated a
20:18 

20:18 computer science deg I grad computer
20:19 

20:19 science but like even before getting
20:22 

20:22 into computer science I already knew
20:24 

20:24 that I would go into computer science
20:26 

20:26 because like yourself I also actually
20:28 

20:28 started making games using flashh flashh
20:31 

20:31 okay so action script right action so
20:33 

20:33 I'm actually visal basic then action
20:36 

20:36 script then Unity okay yes I did I did
20:39 

20:39 not delve into game development though
20:41 

20:41 like after I just went I was then I
20:44 

20:44 joined robotics Club in my
20:47 

20:47 JC that's so cool so then that's when I
20:49 

20:49 started learning about algorithms like
20:51 

20:51 how to get the the micromouse true am
20:54 

20:54 maze oh yeah and that's when like you
20:57 

20:57 know Dept first or breakfast do you join
21:00 

21:00 a micro Mouse competition yeah in JC yes
21:03 

21:03 so then that's how I got into coding and
21:05 

21:05 then then I was like oh yes I'm going to
21:06 

21:06 be a software developer and I'm going to
21:09 

21:09 build my own app and become super
21:13 

21:13 rich even then like it wasn't like I
21:16 

21:16 think the rich part only like comes in
21:18 

21:18 this generation right oh no I was born
21:21 

21:21 to be
21:23 

21:23 rich okay okay we're not revealing our
21:26 

21:26 ages here but like okay yeah you're okay
21:29 

21:29 the truth is like we're all three of us
21:31 

21:31 obviously not super rich like that not a
21:34 

21:34 myth everybody keeps thinking like you
21:36 

21:36 know if you work in like Tech you're
21:38 

21:38 going to be earning the big bucks I
21:40 

21:40 would be sitting here like he was
21:42 

21:42 earning a big bucks yes that is that
21:44 

21:44 yeah definitely just now when you did
21:46 

21:46 talk about you know like how people
21:48 

21:48 would think that yes get into Tech and
21:50 

21:50 then get a get a big buck salary and
21:52 

21:52 then get a house everything that's not
21:54 

21:54 really true I don't have a house and it
21:57 

21:57 Singapore is kind of hard we live in
21:60 

21:60 singap music we we live in Singapore and
22:03 

22:03 so it's different from place from like
22:05 

22:05 country to Country and from job from the
22:08 

22:08 company that you're working for as well
22:10 

22:10 and like how you're getting promoted
22:12 

22:12 within the company so could be in the
22:14 

22:14 same company not be earning the same
22:16 

22:16 salary even so there are a lot of things
22:18 

22:18 at play do not get like blinded by all
22:22 

22:22 of these things make your own decisions
22:24 

22:24 do your own research and it's not just
22:27 

22:27 engineering
22:29 

22:29 even like medical even marketing
22:32 

22:32 accountancy there are big bucks if you
22:34 

22:34 want to so it all depends on your
22:36 

22:36 passion so do what you are passionate
22:39 

22:39 for don't don't do things for money like
22:41 

22:41 especially not a 9 to5 for money yeah
22:45 

22:45 yeah for yeah that shouldn't be like
22:47 

22:47 your aim to like oh I want to go into
22:48 

22:48 this field because of the 9 to5 pays
22:51 

22:51 this much no definitely know yeah yeah
22:55 

22:55 it's definitely about like following
22:56 

22:56 your passion as much as possible about
22:58 

22:58 also not saying that you have to like
22:60 

23:00 you know work at a place that you're
23:02 

23:02 passionate about you know it's a lot
23:04 

23:04 about like pivoting and really rovering
23:06 

23:06 your passions from here and there I mean
23:08 

23:08 just look at the ways that we describe
23:09 

23:09 our journey like we went from like one
23:11 

23:11 area to another and honestly now we're
23:14 

23:14 so discovering right because you know
23:16 

23:16 even though we know like roughly we know
23:18 

23:18 that we're we want to be in a tech uh
23:20 

23:20 industry but even a tech industry like
23:22 

23:22 you mention has so many different
23:23 

23:23 vertical that I I am still exploring
23:26 

23:26 like I feel like being a software
23:28 

23:28 engineer is also a very generic role
23:30 

23:30 that I can just kind of like place
23:31 

23:31 myself for now um but in terms of like
23:34 

23:34 the actual track I'm still kind of
23:36 

23:36 discovering that through like community
23:37 

23:37 events through talking to different
23:38 

23:38 people like robotics engineering and
23:40 

23:40 something new that I came to know about
23:42 

23:42 did not I I think it's stupid but I did
23:44 

23:44 not know that Robotics and software like
23:47 

23:47 come together I mean you need the
23:48 

23:48 software to operate the robot but yeah
23:51 

23:51 these are still things I'm discovering
23:53 

23:53 yeah even though it's been so long in
23:55 

23:55 like um the number of years relative to
23:57 

23:57 like uh people out there but yeah a lot
24:01 

24:01 of people still don't know that all
24:02 

24:02 these different tracks exist and even
24:04 

24:04 within the different tracks there's the
24:06 

24:06 coding tracks and there's the non-coding
24:08 

24:08 tracks like C security um so there's
24:11 

24:11 still so much to discover and talk about
24:13 

24:13 yeah yeah that's why this is actually
24:15 

24:15 something I'm really excited about
24:17 

24:17 through this podcast is we get to
24:18 

24:18 actually meet other people who are non
24:21 

24:21 software Engineers because when people
24:22 

24:22 think oh you're in Tech you're software
24:24 

24:24 engineer like that's so like the common
24:26 

24:26 label and to be honest since was from
24:28 

24:28 Finance I also think oh if I go into
24:30 

24:30 Tech I can only be a software engineer
24:32 

24:32 that's like a one track thing and then
24:33 

24:33 I'm like um okay but what if I want to
24:36 

24:36 try other things right what if I'm
24:37 

24:37 interested in Ai and machine learning so
24:40 

24:40 during my time when I was like kind of
24:42 

24:42 like in covid period it was like you
24:44 

24:44 know everyone was in their homes I kind
24:47 

24:47 of used that time to actually explore
24:49 

24:49 like Devil in different things like I
24:51 

24:51 used the Google auto ml API just to
24:53 

24:53 build my own custom image classification
24:55 

24:55 model and check out machine learning
24:57 

24:57 words oh sorry and and then I attended
25:01 

25:01 many hackathons like back to back just
25:02 

25:02 to like try different Technologies and
25:04 

25:04 see which type do I like cloud computing
25:07 

25:07 or do I like web development like what
25:09 

25:09 what exactly do I want in Tech basically
25:12 

25:12 so in a way this podcast I'm also really
25:15 

25:15 excited about just learning how to
25:17 

25:17 navigate through Tech like we get to
25:18 

25:18 explore ourselves as well for us and for
25:21 

25:21 maybe the people who are listening right
25:23 

25:23 yeah yeah exactly and therefore we have
25:25 

25:25 R Tech yeah so like why we call rag tag
25:29 

25:29 I mean we talk about how we came on this
25:32 

25:32 podcast idea but the notion of rag tag
25:34 

25:34 it came from the word like rag tag r a g
25:36 

25:36 which means like a disorganized group of
25:38 

25:38 people group of thoughts which is kind
25:40 

25:40 of like how a conversations go it goes
25:42 

25:42 from one to another as as you can see
25:44 

25:44 from the last I don't know how many
25:46 

25:46 minutes um but you basically just change
25:48 

25:48 the th to
25:49 

25:49 te and um inside joke is that it's a
25:52 

25:52 camel case if you know what it is then
25:54 

25:54 yeah good for you you're in the right
25:55 

25:55 place but yeah that's kind of like what
25:57 

25:57 we arrived snat and then our tagline um
26:00 

26:00 which we well you came up with it bites
26:03 

26:03 and banter so so so disclaimer I did not
26:07 

26:07 come up with it it's it's awesome but
26:09 

26:09 Chad GPD did help us get to it so yeah
26:13 

26:13 bites and bent basically bytes is b t s
26:17 

26:17 so bits and bites btes so this would be
26:20 

26:20 like bite-sized information for you guys
26:23 

26:23 on uh regarding Tech and also ban where
26:26 

26:26 you know the three of us coming together
26:28 

26:28 M we'll be talking about this from our
26:30 

26:30 own perspectives from our own opinion so
26:32 

26:32 we will be you know like questioning
26:35 

26:35 each other like oh why why this why that
26:37 

26:37 and bringing this all for you guys uh so
26:40 

26:40 that's our teline bites and B and yeah
26:42 

26:42 light-heartedness of course so yeah yeah
26:45 

26:45 we're just going to keep it chill just
26:46 

26:46 like our usual conversations and
26:48 

26:48 obviously it's not just three of us
26:50 

26:50 we're looking to bring in a lot of other
26:51 

26:51 people because you know software
26:53 

26:53 engineer software engineer uh Solutions
26:54 

26:54 engineer like we see we're still still
26:56 

26:56 trying to discover like different tracks
26:58 

26:58 we're also trying to explore like
26:60 

26:60 bringing our non-technical friends in
27:02 

27:02 and also asking them like what are your
27:04 

27:04 perspectives on the tech industry like
27:07 

27:07 do you have any misconceptions for us to
27:08 

27:08 pass and also maybe try out segments
27:10 

27:10 like we attempt to explain like cloud
27:13 

27:13 computing Concepts to a non- Tey and see
27:15 

27:15 your reaction do anything like the cloud
27:17 

27:17 is a physical cloud like Google drive or
27:19 

27:19 something like that like I think those
27:20 

27:20 are things that we want to exp sad just
27:22 

27:22 really keeping it casual and
27:23 

27:23 light-hearted yeah so I think um all in
27:27 

27:27 all I think this is a very good start
27:30 

27:30 for us and we just being able to
27:33 

27:33 casually hang out here uh I know like
27:36 

27:36 probably in the first few episodes maybe
27:38 

27:38 it will be slightly awkward cuz you know
27:39 

27:39 we we we go through a lot to like get
27:42 

27:42 here like so this is our emotional
27:44 

27:44 support cat right this is PIP um pip is
27:48 

27:48 uh well she's my cat but she used to be
27:50 

27:50 my foster cat she's named after um the
27:53 

27:53 python package installer yeah like pip
27:55 

27:55 install also because like you know she
27:57 

27:57 pits a lot like she goes I mean she
27:59 

27:59 she's sleeping now maybe next time but
28:02 

28:02 yay emotional support yeah cuz we know
28:04 

28:04 that um in the next first few episodes
28:06 

28:06 we might
28:08 

28:08 need support we like we we are not the
28:12 

28:12 most extroverted people but we we like
28:16 

28:16 sharing our knowledge we like so like uh
28:18 

28:18 my Moto in life is like teaching is the
28:22 

28:22 best way to learn so the more I talk
28:23 

28:23 about it the more I teach it would be
28:27 

28:27 better for me
28:29 

28:29 so actually sorry I've lost track of
28:31 

28:31 what I was saying oh yeah no no that's
28:33 

28:33 fine yeah I remember you saying this
28:35 

28:35 that like you teach as a way to learn
28:37 

28:37 because it's only by teaching that you
28:39 

28:39 are able to condense that information
28:41 

28:41 and you hear yourself teaching and you
28:43 

28:43 force yourself through the process and
28:44 

28:44 to like think oh exactly why why exactly
28:47 

28:47 am I saying such thing so yeah yeah so
28:49 

28:49 that's that's what this is and and I
28:52 

28:52 actually like while you were explaining
28:54 

28:54 I I realized ironically Tech is like
28:58 

28:58 tech knowledge and everything is like
28:60 

29:00 literally at our fingertips right and
29:03 

29:03 even then it is so convoluted there's so
29:06 

29:06 many aspects to it that even though it's
29:08 

29:08 right out there it's half of the
29:10 

29:10 information is free on YouTube on like
29:13 

29:13 so many different articles but why is it
29:15 

29:15 still so complicated why is it still so
29:18 

29:18 blackbox to so many people exactly so
29:21 

29:21 that's why there is a need for such a
29:24 

29:24 platform where you know people try to
29:27 

29:27 like we will try to like help make it
29:29 

29:29 more accessible like explain things that
29:32 

29:32 there's there's no need to get
29:34 

29:34 overwhelmed cuz we have been through our
29:36 

29:36 own phases where we have been
29:37 

29:37 overwhelmed by the tech world so yeah so
29:41 

29:41 this is our attempt to demystify things
29:44 

29:44 and bring the the calm to to Tech bring
29:49 

29:49 the calm so far listeners I'm literally
29:52 

29:52 doing the calm movement with my hands
29:54 

29:54 the calm the calm cat the calm hook
29:57 

29:57 hopefully
29:59 

29:59 us and yeah we'll be the average Jane in
30:03 

30:03 in in the tech industry we'll be like
30:05 

30:05 the neighbor the the tech neighbor
30:07 

30:07 friendly neighborhood friendly
30:10 

30:10 neighborhood your friendly neighborhood
30:12 

30:12 techie person yeah no if we call
30:15 

30:15 ourselves that like people are going to
30:16 

30:16 call us in to fix your computers like my
30:20 

30:20 my parents would just just assume that I
30:22 

30:22 know how to like do anything computer
30:24 

30:24 related anything like I don't know
30:26 

30:26 Appliance related yeah
30:28 

30:28 like they keep asking me to fix the
30:30 

30:30 printer and this is funny cuz I when I
30:32 

30:32 first uh like got into computer science
30:35 

30:35 like in uni the first thing I asked my
30:37 

30:37 mom and dad was like do you think I
30:39 

30:39 would be able to fix the light bulb
30:40 

30:40 after my uni okay so you you used to be
30:44 

30:44 on board on that train I I was of that
30:47 

30:47 thinking like I can fix any electrical
30:49 

30:49 Appliance after my computer science
30:51 

30:51 graduation oh my like that's what who
30:54 

30:54 I'm going to be you just negated the
30:55 

30:55 whole electrical engineering department
30:58 

30:58 like I'll just do everything
31:01 

31:01 City not not just computer electric city
31:05 

31:05 oh
31:06 

31:06 electricity it'll be my fingertips
31:09 

31:09 you'll be the electricity superheroes
31:11 

31:11 yeah is it just because you did you use
31:13 

31:13 Flash it's always like electricity yes
31:16 

31:16 if I can do flash I can do anything girl
31:20 

31:20 no not really but yeah as a whole I
31:24 

31:24 think like that's why we've decided to
31:26 

31:26 try this podcast out it's not going to
31:28 

31:28 be like the easiest thing for us um but
31:31 

31:31 you know this is something that we're
31:32 

31:32 experimenting with something we're
31:34 

31:34 trying to get out of our comfort zone so
31:36 

31:36 that more people can listen to this
31:39 

31:39 relate to this you know try things out
31:41 

31:41 as we kind of like talk about it and
31:42 

31:42 explore it together with us just as
31:45 

31:45 we're exploring it as well so yeah that
31:48 

31:48 is us we are Rec Tech um actually did we
31:52 

31:52 introduce ourselves no we have no okay I
31:54 

31:54 will introduce ourselves now um I'm
31:56 

31:56 Natasha software

31:59 engineer I'm Salone I'm also a software
32:01 

32:01 engineer and I am Victoria I'm a
32:04 

32:04 Solutions engineer and also Tech blogger
32:07 

32:07 on the site yes we will definitely have
32:09 

32:09 like an episode to like explain what
32:11 

32:11 Solutions engineer is yeah because I
32:13 

32:13 know like people kind of get confused
32:14 

32:14 with that and we will also have episodes
32:16 

32:16 to explain like what you know what is a
32:18 

32:18 software engineer actually so yeah don't
32:20 

32:20 worry about that we'll come to that yeah
32:22 

32:22 I'm not going to explain it like right
