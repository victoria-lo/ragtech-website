00:01 okay okay so um we're gonna CL I was
00:06 

00:06 just making myself up
00:12 

00:12 okay this can be behind the
00:15 

00:15 [Music]
00:18 

00:18 scen hello everybody we are R Tech I'm
00:20 

00:20 Natasha a software engineer I'm Salon
00:22 

00:22 software engineer and I'm Victoria
00:24 

00:24 Solutions engineer and together we are
00:26 

00:26 re Tech today's episode will be all
00:28 

00:28 about mentorship um this was a topic
00:31 

00:31 that was kind of requested by a few
00:33 

00:33 viewers um especially those uh in the
00:35 

00:35 tech industry already as well as outside
00:37 

00:37 as well um because I think mentorship is
00:39 

00:39 quite a generic topic that everybody um
00:42 

00:42 thinks about in their own Industries so
00:45 

00:45 uh we decided to do this topic today um
00:47 

00:47 on mentorship um so first off I'll just
00:50 

00:50 kind of start off with um kind of like a
00:53 

00:53 a question for Salone actually because
00:56 

00:56 amongst three of us um you're the most
00:58 

00:58 experienced ones and if I were to place
00:60 

00:60 it I think um both of us would likely be
01:03 

01:03 in the space of seeking mentors where
01:05 

01:05 for you I feel like people seek you for
01:07 

01:07 mentors uh for mentorship so uh how has
01:10 

01:10 your experience been like um what how
01:13 

01:13 would you describe your phase in life
01:14 

01:14 right now as a senior a software
01:16 

01:16 engineer and do people come to you for
01:18 

01:18 uh mentorship and
01:20 

01:20 advice um okay
01:23 

01:23 so so personally I've actually never had
01:26 

01:26 my own Mentor actually uh but yes I I
01:30 

01:30 have been a mentor at certain programs
01:33 

01:33 like within our community like women
01:35 

01:35 code had a mentorship program Tech
01:37 

01:37 ladies had a mentorship program I was a
01:40 

01:40 mentor in those programs cuz I had like
01:44 

01:44 uh five plus years experience already
01:46 

01:46 till till then and uh usually that's
01:49 

01:49 what I've been seeing that the entry
01:52 

01:52 level software Engineers would they
01:55 

01:55 would want a mentor with either a lot of
01:59 

01:59 experience like 10 plus years experience
02:00 

02:00 or they actually also want someone with
02:02 

02:02 just a few more years ahead of them to
02:05 

02:05 also just see uh how how they can just
02:08 

02:08 you know leap through that far yeah so
02:11 

02:11 uh how it's been I mean it's not like
02:14 

02:14 people come up to me and like Oh Be My
02:15 

02:15 Mentor be my mentor that that people
02:18 

02:18 would like do that because especially
02:20 

02:20 with you being the director of women and
02:21 

02:21 code and then in your organization as
02:23 

02:23 well in the different companies you've
02:25 

02:25 been in I was actually wondering if
02:26 

02:26 people just come up to you and ask like
02:28 

02:28 can you actually be my mentor or but
02:30 

02:30 you're saying it's not that explicit no
02:32 

02:32 I I mean I didn't have anyone come up to
02:35 

02:35 me saying that uh if I was like a part
02:38 

02:38 of a mentorship program then also no one
02:41 

02:41 had like special request to have Salone
02:45 

02:45 but uh yeah so it has been I really love
02:50 

02:50 uh mentoring but I mean I don't see it
02:52 

02:52 as like mentoring like oh reach where I
02:55 

02:55 am kind of thing I I see it as uh like
02:59 

02:59 also want to see like what's happening
03:01 

03:01 in like a few years before like a like
03:05 

03:05 the the younger generation like what's
03:07 

03:07 happening in the entry level right now
03:10 

03:10 and uh definitely I do have some words
03:12 

03:12 of advice like some things that I could
03:14 

03:14 have done better or like uh some
03:17 

03:17 experiences that is kind of like a right
03:19 

03:19 of passage that I would like to tell
03:21 

03:21 them that or don't worry or don't don't
03:22 

03:22 stress out about this it it happens and
03:24 

03:24 you can deal with it in a certain manner
03:26 

03:26 so I do like to share my knowledge and
03:29 

03:29 my experience so I like to do that uh
03:33 

03:33 but yeah so that's how I look at it I
03:36 

03:36 definitely wouldn't ever tell my M that
03:39 

03:39 uh you have to do things in a certain
03:41 

03:41 way or something it's like I always have
03:42 

03:42 a have an open mind that different
03:44 

03:44 people would have different ways of
03:46 

03:46 reaching some certain goals uh I
03:49 

03:49 definitely only have this one track that
03:52 

03:52 I've taken so I don't know about the
03:53 

03:53 other tracks I always tell them that
03:55 

03:55 it's this is my opinion this is how I
03:57 

03:57 did it this is what my experience taught
03:59 

03:59 me so so you are open to trying out
04:02 

04:02 other things but just just know that
04:04 

04:04 there would be these outcomes and like
04:07 

04:07 you can still get over things in a
04:08 

04:08 certain way so I I look at it in that
04:11 

04:11 manner like so I also get to learn from
04:13 

04:13 them and there are different experiences
04:15 

04:15 that's
04:16 

04:16 happening uh and I get to like also
04:19 

04:19 share my own and that that that feels
04:21 

04:21 like a like a reflection sometimes so I
04:24 

04:24 like sharing like oh what happened to me
04:26 

04:26 like a few years ago in this company in
04:28 

04:28 that project yeah for sure I I really
04:31 

04:31 like what you said about um how you know
04:34 

04:34 with mentorship a lot of people think
04:35 

04:35 it's a oneway learning process like if
04:37 

04:37 you taught of something that it's just
04:39 

04:39 me absorbing but for you you approach it
04:42 

04:42 as a way of learning so um actually when
04:46 

04:46 it comes to like the I guess younger I
04:48 

04:48 don't want to say younger generation
04:50 

04:50 it's not younger generation generation
04:52 

04:52 it's just the mty yeah it could be
04:56 

04:56 anyone it could be an even more
04:57 

04:57 experienced person wanting to seek
04:59 

04:59 mentorship in some other aspects or it
05:03 

05:03 could be the other way around yeah yeah
05:04 

05:04 cuz my organization actually tried uh a
05:08 

05:08 pilot reverse mentoring program actually
05:11 

05:11 um which by itself was kind of like a
05:13 

05:13 misnomer I felt because like reverse
05:16 

05:16 mentoring it's like it really Bears the
05:18 

05:18 assumption that there's a one-way
05:21 

05:21 mentoring process and you're reversing
05:23 

05:23 it but okay I understand it was a pilot
05:24 

05:24 trial uh and it was a big thing for any
05:27 

05:27 organization um but it was interesting
05:30 

05:30 um for me to be in that program because
05:32 

05:32 I had always seen it as a 2-way process
05:34 

05:34 when I would be I I was in a program
05:36 

05:36 where I was assigned mentors actually um
05:39 

05:39 it was um kind of like a a systemized uh
05:42 

05:42 mentorship program which uh unlike in uh
05:45 

05:45 your experience you said that actually
05:47 

05:47 you don't throw the what mentors around
05:49 

05:49 it just kind of naturally happens um but
05:51 

05:51 in my organization they would match us
05:54 

05:54 um quite deliberately with um mentors
05:56 

05:56 that they felt um could uh benefit
05:60 

06:00 that we could benefit from um so I think
06:04 

06:04 that process of attaching a label to
06:08 

06:08 mentorship was kind of inorganic for me
06:10 

06:10 because firstly it's the assumption that
06:12 

06:12 you only have one Mentor uh in your
06:15 

06:15 organization and in life but actually
06:17 

06:17 when I reflected on it I had multiple
06:18 

06:18 for different domains of my life I
06:20 

06:20 benefited from diverse opinions and a
06:22 

06:22 lot of times it was a two-way exchange I
06:25 

06:25 felt like like you said uh as much as I
06:27 

06:27 was asking them questions you know they
06:29 

06:29 were also asking me and we were going
06:32 

06:32 back to like our work domains or our
06:34 

06:34 personal life domains with new knowledge
06:36 

06:36 that we both learned um so it's
06:38 

06:38 interesting just seeing that and hearing
06:40 

06:40 from you how organic and informal that
06:42 

06:42 process is you don't even think about it
06:44 

06:44 but it's just like when people say oh
06:46 

06:46 yeah I guess I was indeed a mentor to
06:48 

06:48 this person kind of thing but for me
06:50 

06:50 it's just like yeah I was assigned a
06:52 

06:52 mentor and I was even part of a reever
06:53 

06:53 reverse mentorship program um which was
06:56 

06:56 kind of interesting the full question I
06:58 

06:58 have for this like that was was my
07:00 

07:00 experience as in a a systemized um
07:03 

07:03 mentorship program but for uh Victoria I
07:06 

07:06 was actually wondering for you people
07:08 

07:08 seek your mentorship for say technical
07:10 

07:10 blogging as well as like your journey uh
07:13 

07:13 um venturing into uh software
07:15 

07:15 engineering um and now in Solutions
07:17 

07:17 engineering but for you do you seek out
07:20 

07:20 mentors on your own uh and how would you
07:22 

07:22 describe your phase of um life and
07:24 

07:24 mentorship right now okay uh yeah that's
07:26 

07:26 a good question so actually I agree with
07:29 

07:29 whatever you guys mentioned as well I
07:30 

07:30 think that for me at least people who
07:33 

07:33 seek uh for me for like mentorship I
07:36 

07:36 would often tell them that I don't
07:38 

07:38 really have much to teach because I am
07:42 

07:42 just someone who's also continuously
07:43 

07:43 learning and everything that's based on
07:46 

07:46 my experience is just solely my
07:48 

07:48 experience so I kind of have this
07:50 

07:50 contradicting view that you don't really
07:52 

07:52 need mentorship it's more like when
07:55 

07:55 you're in a community that's when you
07:57 

07:57 can learn the most you can learn from
07:59 

07:59 all different types of of people because
08:01 

08:01 no one is really a master in everything
08:04 

08:04 like we all have different experiences
08:06 

08:06 so that makes us who we are so I cannot
08:08 

08:08 tell you like oh if this is what I do
08:11 

08:11 you can succeed or like you know you can
08:14 

08:14 follow me you know like I I think
08:16 

08:16 everyone would Forge their own path so
08:19 

08:19 if people ask me for mentorship I say um
08:22 

08:22 I'm not really there yet or like I don't
08:25 

08:25 even think about like being a mentor
08:27 

08:27 it's more like if you want to learn from
08:29 

08:29 like maybe from my journey or my advice
08:32 

08:32 my story I can basically share that so
08:35 

08:35 kind of like how Salone mentioned about
08:36 

08:36 sharing knowledge like I like to share
08:38 

08:38 my knowledge and if you want to take
08:40 

08:40 that as something like oh that that is a
08:42 

08:42 good reference for me to like maybe
08:44 

08:44 apply a little bit there's some
08:46 

08:46 similarity there then that's good but I
08:48 

08:48 don't want to tell them like you said
08:51 

08:51 right like you have to do it this way
08:52 

08:52 this is the only it's not right
08:55 

08:55 definitely and especially just during
08:56 

08:56 early days of my career when I was
08:58 

08:58 pivoting from Finance into Tech that
09:01 

09:01 part is when I read a lot of blogs of
09:04 

09:04 like different people from different
09:05 

09:05 walks of life how they also transition
09:08 

09:08 into Tech and I would say not a single
09:10 

09:10 person have the exact same story and
09:13 

09:13 that makes a lot of sense because no one
09:15 

09:15 would experience the same thing no one
09:17 

09:17 would have the same skills from the
09:19 

09:19 beginning so when people ask me oh how
09:21 

09:21 do you transition into Tech I say yes
09:23 

09:23 this is how I do it but that does not
09:25 

09:25 mean that's the only way to do it yeah
09:28 

09:28 yeah so the best I can do is just you
09:31 

09:31 know give them what I've experienced and
09:33 

09:33 maybe they can take something away from
09:35 

09:35 it so um actually Last year me and Sono
09:38 

09:38 we organize a eight month long
09:40 

09:40 mentorship program through women who C
09:42 

09:42 and Tech ladies and I also learned a lot
09:44 

09:44 about the mentor Mente relationship in
09:46 

09:46 that part where like you mentioned
09:49 

09:49 Natasha it's definitely two-way cuz at
09:51 

09:51 the end of the eight months of
09:52 

09:52 everything I talk to the mentors I talk
09:54 

09:54 to the mentees all of them learn
09:56 

09:56 something from each other it's not
09:58 

09:58 definitely not one way kind of
09:59 

09:59 relationship so I think the term
10:02 

10:02 mentorship can be more about like just a
10:05 

10:05 relationship basically yeah yeah a
10:07 

10:07 relationship of you know learning from
10:09 

10:09 each other kind yeah it also goes back
10:11 

10:11 to like what I used to say like teaching
10:13 

10:13 is the best way to learn so like you are
10:17 

10:17 kind of teaching like oh you can do it a
10:19 

10:19 certain way and this is why you should
10:21 

10:21 do it a certain way and then you're also
10:23 

10:23 learning from that process like oh this
10:25 

10:25 is what I learned and reflect on it and
10:27 

10:27 things like that so yeah it's definitely
10:29 

10:29 two way like it's it's never one that's
10:32 

10:32 why I really just find myself sometimes
10:33 

10:33 immersed in like reading other people's
10:35 

10:35 blogs because like they all just have
10:38 

10:38 such different experience that like sure
10:40 

10:40 it might not be exactly my experience
10:42 

10:42 but I just really like to hear them
10:43 

10:43 sharing that part like how they overcome
10:46 

10:46 their own struggles and just doing that
10:48 

10:48 is inspiring so it's inspiring to me and
10:51 

10:51 I hope to give back that inspiration as
10:53 

10:53 well like through my blogs my own blogs
10:55 

10:55 so I think overall the mentorship part
10:58 

10:58 is about um taking from various sources
11:02 

11:02 not just one right and then learning
11:05 

11:05 like each part of them they all have
11:06 

11:06 some wisdom to share and then learn from
11:09 

11:09 all of them yeah yeah yeah I I think I
11:11 

11:11 basically both of you uh both Converge
11:14 

11:14 on sort of the same rhetoric that even
11:17 

11:17 though you use a libal mentorship but
11:19 

11:19 it's really more about sharing knowledge
11:21 

11:21 and more than just sharing just
11:23 

11:23 knowledge it's I'm sharing my experience
11:26 

11:26 um and these are my opinions based on my
11:28 

11:28 perspective of whatever domain uh you're
11:31 

11:31 interested in but um you don't come with
11:34 

11:34 the mindset that you have to take my
11:36 

11:36 advice as is in fact like don't like I
11:38 

11:38 I'm just Shar you want to emphasize that
11:40 

11:40 this is my personal experience and pro
11:43 

11:43 and both of you also insinuated that you
11:45 

11:45 you should probably also look for other
11:47 

11:47 opinions as well and you know in sort of
11:50 

11:50 like the mentee perspective the
11:52 

11:52 obligation on the mentee in this case is
11:54 

11:54 to seek multiple mentors seek multiple
11:57 

11:57 opinions and I think it becomes more fun
11:59 

11:59 right right when people are already in
12:01 

12:01 that process they come to you as a
12:02 

12:02 mentor and you share your experience and
12:04 

12:04 they come back with oh yeah actually I
12:05 

12:05 was talking to this other person and
12:07 

12:07 that experience sounds similar or like
12:08 

12:08 oh they actually said this other thing
12:10 

12:10 and you know that becomes like it's no
12:13 

12:13 longer like a one-on-one Mentor mentee
12:15 

12:15 relationship it's your experiences and
12:18 

12:18 your experiences talking to different
12:19 

12:19 people converging into one and it's also
12:23 

12:23 not just like a single conversation um
12:26 

12:26 that's why with like the traditional
12:28 

12:28 systemized mentorship program progr
12:29 

12:29 there's always like a Cadence and a
12:31 

12:31 frequency with the tech ladies program
12:33 

12:33 it was 8 months yeah but eight month
12:35 

12:35 it's not saying that the mentorship ends
12:37 

12:37 at 8 months uh you're trying to
12:38 

12:38 emphasize that it's this continued uh
12:41 

12:41 frequency of interaction and post8
12:43 

12:43 months you hope that they've built that
12:45 

12:45 kind of trust and that understanding of
12:47 

12:47 what mentorship really means you know
12:48 

12:48 it's not just a word it's like that
12:50 

12:50 mindset of wanting to find different
12:52 

12:52 people to learn from yeah I actually
12:54 

12:54 have a personal story um recently just
12:57 

12:57 caught up with one of the mentors from
12:59 

12:59 the mentorship program it's been long
13:01 

13:01 after the mentorship program but he
13:03 

13:03 still often meets with his Mente even
13:06 

13:06 until today it's an ongoing relationship
13:08 

13:08 and whenever I hear those stories it
13:10 

13:10 just felt so heartwarming like they met
13:12 

13:12 through this mentorship program that we
13:14 

13:14 match them with and at first it's like
13:17 

13:17 both of them are not really sure like
13:19 

13:19 he's a newbie Mentor she's a newbie
13:21 

13:21 mentee and they both just meet in that
13:24 

13:24 environment and that's when like just
13:26 

13:26 all the conversation start flowing and
13:28 

13:28 they are able to navigate with through
13:30 

13:30 each others you know just by discussions
13:32 

13:32 and often communicating they manag to
13:36 

13:36 actually both of them find something
13:38 

13:38 more valuable and more meaningful in
13:40 

13:40 their Journeys so I think when I hear
13:42 

13:42 those stories I felt like it makes it
13:44 

13:44 all worth it and they themselves know
13:46 

13:46 that this is a two-way relationship like
13:48 

13:48 both of them will find the time to meet
13:50 

13:50 each other and to catch up and making
13:52 

13:52 sure that everyone is you know happy
13:55 

13:55 yeah yeah yeah so just want to share
13:57 

13:57 that yeah actually that's that's nice
13:59 

13:59 that you sh like it was like we were the
14:01 

14:01 papa te made it happen yeah yeah you
14:04 

14:04 really like the I actually like touching
14:06 

14:06 on this topic um what I've realized
14:08 

14:08 after like meeting different people you
14:09 

14:09 know we've all met different people had
14:11 

14:11 different events there seems to be a
14:13 

14:13 very clear group of people that come up
14:16 

14:16 to us after one it's like people seeking
14:19 

14:19 more advice more mentorships so the
14:21 

14:21 mentees and then there's also the group
14:23 

14:23 where um they're actually looking to
14:25 

14:25 give to share and they want to look for
14:27 

14:27 people who are uh in that same uh uh uh
14:30 

14:30 process of trying to um learn from
14:32 

14:32 others as well and I think like what we
14:35 

14:35 do in our organizations is basically
14:37 

14:37 create this bridge for people like the
14:39 

14:39 eight-month program that both of you
14:41 

14:41 shared about but also in our personal um
14:44 

14:44 Journeys as we talk and speak to people
14:46 

14:46 also connecting people to each other so
14:48 

14:48 I think that's also a very like um
14:50 

14:50 unstated part of quote unquote
14:53 

14:53 mentorship it's also the people and the
14:55 

14:55 organizations that try to bridge this
14:57 

14:57 group of people who want to learn learn
14:59 

14:59 and this group of people who want to
15:00 

15:00 give but in the process both learn and
15:02 

15:02 give together and I think that's by
15:05 

15:05 itself it's a very um poetic and
15:09 

15:09 beautiful kind of thing that it's it's
15:10 

15:10 so discreet right like you know when uh
15:13 

15:13 you hear about these two people the
15:15 

15:15 mentors and mentees meeting even after
15:17 

15:17 the program you know you feel like wow
15:19 

15:19 I've actually done something um perhaps
15:22 

15:22 to like the people in these programs um
15:24 

15:24 they I I'm sure like they're very
15:26 

15:26 thankful for for the program itself but
15:28 

15:28 you don't really I how much of an impact
15:30 

15:30 that you've had on somebody's lives
15:31 

15:31 until you know you hear these stories
15:33 

15:33 and I think that's really nice I do want
15:35 

15:35 to throw a curveball in this because um
15:38 

15:38 I spoke with some people from uh
15:39 

15:39 different mentorship programs including
15:41 

15:41 uh the one that we talked about
15:43 

15:43 including um my my own like mentorship
15:46 

15:46 programs in my organization and honestly
15:49 

15:49 there were mentors I was matched with or
15:52 

15:52 mentees um other people have matched
15:54 

15:54 with they just didn't click and they did
15:56 

15:56 not follow from that um that mentorship
15:59 

15:59 program uh process so I wanted to ask
16:02 

16:02 both of you um I guess this goes into
16:05 

16:05 like what do you look for in uh when you
16:07 

16:07 want to learn from someone um when
16:09 

16:09 you're seeking a mentor or a mentee and
16:12 

16:12 what do you not look out for where do
16:13 

16:13 you know that okay this is probably not
16:15 

16:15 going to work out have you had those
16:17 

16:17 experiences can I go first Yeah so
16:20 

16:20 basically just based on my experiences
16:22 

16:22 like through personal stories and also
16:24 

16:24 through this mentorship program that we
16:26 

16:26 organize is that when we're matching
16:27 

16:27 mentees and mentors we must make sure
16:29 

16:29 both of their goals aligned and I do
16:32 

16:32 notice that some M and Mentor
16:34 

16:34 relationship that actually fall apart is
16:37 

16:37 because they do not have the same goals
16:39 

16:39 or they were not clear about each
16:40 

16:40 other's goals so they become confused
16:43 

16:43 how to help and then the mentee will be
16:46 

16:46 confused what to ask for help in so when
16:49 

16:49 there's that confusion there's just no
16:51 

16:51 Clarity like it's all a fog and people
16:53 

16:53 just start like feeling like oh this is
16:55 

16:55 a waste of time and then they decided
16:57 

16:57 not to communicate anymore so usually it
16:60 

16:60 all boils down into both parties having
17:02 

17:02 clear objectives what do they want out
17:04 

17:04 of this relationship um it might sound a
17:06 

17:06 bit transactional like you know what do
17:08 

17:08 you want out of this relationship but in
17:10 

17:10 a way or another it is like the reason
17:13 

17:13 why they want to come together in the
17:15 

17:15 first place so they do need to define
17:17 

17:17 the objectives clearly and during our
17:20 

17:20 mentorship kickoff we do mention some of
17:22 

17:22 like expectations does and don'ts of you
17:24 

17:24 know being in a mentorship and one of
17:26 

17:26 the don'ts is don't expect your mentor
17:29 

17:29 like for the M perspective don't expect
17:31 

17:31 them to give you everything like give
17:33 

17:33 you oh here's the the book of life and
17:36 

17:36 you will be this a curriculum like yeah
17:38 

17:38 what you yeah I think most mentees came
17:40 

17:40 in with that expectation also that oh my
17:43 

17:43 mentor is going to help me do everything
17:45 

17:45 or like they're going to give me all
17:46 

17:46 these contexts and I'm going to be like
17:48 

17:48 super super duper great at all this like
17:51 

17:51 in my career and I'm going to just
17:53 

17:53 launch to like you know a successful
17:55 

17:55 Journey but that's not the case they
17:57 

17:57 also have to put an effort in their own
17:59 

17:59 part and of course all the mentor can do
18:02 

18:02 is give advice guide but they cannot
18:06 

18:06 give them the fish you know they only
18:09 

18:09 teach them how to fish so at the end of
18:11 

18:11 the day it's all about also managing
18:13 

18:13 expectations so knowing your objectives
18:16 

18:16 and managing expectations of each other
18:18 

18:18 yeah like even the commitment levels
18:20 

18:20 like some mentees and mentors they don't
18:23 

18:23 align in their commitment level some
18:25 

18:25 maybe want to meet more frequently than
18:26 

18:26 others that can also cause some you know
18:29 

18:29 disagreement in general but yeah so want
18:32 

18:32 to add anything I don't I mean
18:35 

18:35 definitely like uh it's because we are
18:37 

18:37 matching them there would be some
18:38 

18:38 hiccups here and there there were a few
18:40 

18:40 dropouts and like people who didn't want
18:42 

18:42 that Mentor that mentee uh but I think
18:46 

18:46 the end of it is like you you have to
18:48 

18:48 know that you have to respect each
18:49 

18:49 other's time and yeah I think the
18:52 

18:52 respect is respect each other
18:54 

18:54 actually uh but like uh back to your
18:57 

18:57 question on like what should we look out
18:59 

18:59 for what shouldn't we look out for in
19:01 

19:01 our Mentor I was actually just
19:03 

19:03 reflecting like as as we were conversing
19:06 

19:06 that actually I myself didn't or don't
19:09 

19:09 have a mentor in in my entire Journey
19:12 

19:12 yet and it might have been a bit
19:15 

19:15 deliberate I think in my case cuz I used
19:20 

19:20 to fear that having a mentor would hold
19:24 

19:24 me too accountable in the sense that uh
19:29 

19:29 you know what if like like at that point
19:31 

19:31 I used to think that it would be one way
19:35 

19:35 right so I used to have a fear that it
19:37 

19:37 might be a bit too controlling then that
19:40 

19:40 I would have to uh you know commit to a
19:44 

19:44 few things that they have to offer and I
19:47 

19:47 have to follow that and I have to meet
19:48 

19:48 certain goals in certain time and I
19:52 

19:52 might not be able to go on my own
19:54 

19:54 trajectory or like explore things uh on
19:57 

19:57 my own and I also wasn't sure what do I
19:60 

19:60 want exactly like a couple of years ago
20:03 

20:03 even now I mean I can't say I know what
20:04 

20:04 exactly I want so I kind of liked that
20:07 

20:07 I'm still searching and trying to PVE my
20:10 

20:10 own path here and there not to say that
20:12 

20:12 I don't have mentors at all I do have uh
20:15 

20:15 like you men pseudo mentors like in Tech
20:18 

20:18 influencers like I follow a few
20:20 

20:20 influencers where I do have the thing
20:22 

20:22 that oh I want to be like them like you
20:24 

20:24 know influence in Tech have like a a
20:28 

20:28 follow of myself uh things like so I
20:31 

20:31 look out for I look like I look out for
20:34 

20:34 these kind of people and I kind of
20:36 

20:36 follow their path whatever they're
20:38 

20:38 showing on social media and uh I'll
20:40 

20:40 support them even uh so I actually like
20:43 

20:43 buy merchandise and like causes for of
20:48 

20:48 these people who who really do good in
20:51 

20:51 like like this one influence I follow uh
20:53 

20:53 she's she's from India so it's kti pwani
20:57 

20:57 she started off we like doing Tech
20:59 

20:59 influencing and like and she'll also
21:01 

21:01 bring her own personality onto that
21:03 

21:03 space and now she's she started teaching
21:06 

21:06 like DSA and system design
21:09 

21:09 causes again uh data structures and
21:12 

21:12 algorithm okay okay I don't know why I
21:13 

21:13 was thinking direct School
21:16 

21:16 admission no really stupid with acon we
21:20 

21:20 should always clarify for audience as
21:22 

21:22 well so the structures and algorithms
21:25 

21:25 and system design she's a software
21:26 

21:26 developer and then I I signed up for one
21:29 

21:29 of her course and it was so so good like
21:32 

21:32 her way of teaching is so good so that
21:35 

21:35 even if I so like I actually want to uh
21:39 

21:39 want to encourage others to get her
21:41 

21:41 course because I think she's so good and
21:43 

21:43 she deserves people to follow her and
21:46 

21:46 get her course and like go to even
21:48 

21:48 higher so so she's kind of like a she
21:51 

21:51 doesn't know she's a mentor to me but
21:53 

21:53 she could be in that aspect that she
21:55 

21:55 does give her advice on on her channels
21:58 

21:58 as well so I do follow a few people and
22:00 

22:00 like follow certain traits of theirs
22:03 

22:03 that I would like to also incorporate so
22:06 

22:06 in that way I have pseudo mentors they
22:09 

22:09 don't know they are my mentors but
22:10 

22:10 they're there and uh yeah so like I
22:13 

22:13 don't one person to be accountable and I
22:16 

22:16 I I fear that a little bit so I wouldn't
22:20 

22:20 actively go out there and seek a mentor
22:22 

22:22 like that but I would appreciate talking
22:24 

22:24 to people not at a mentor position but
22:28 

22:28 like please do share your experiences or
22:31 

22:31 like what advice do you have to give and
22:33 

22:33 not have the thinking that I would heat
22:36 

22:36 to your advice or something yeah no
22:39 

22:39 actually like we keep coming to the same
22:41 

22:41 um conclusion it's that I think the word
22:44 

22:44 mentorship is way too singular it's too
22:47 

22:47 one way and we all didn't really fite
22:50 

22:50 with that way of learning through people
22:52 

22:52 but we've all been kind of in our own
22:54 

22:54 way seeking our own people to learn from
22:56 

22:56 picking our own people to learn from
22:58 

22:58 also sharing knowledge and not really
23:00 

23:00 picking our mentees but also through
23:02 

23:02 conversations realizing that we share
23:04 

23:04 knowledge organically and I like what
23:06 

23:06 you said it's basically just a
23:07 

23:07 relationship it's just a friendship it's
23:09 

23:09 just a relationship uh mentorship is
23:11 

23:11 just one way to describe it um and I
23:14 

23:14 think perhaps this term was created more
23:17 

23:17 uh in an institution where you know like
23:19 

23:19 in my case where the organization had to
23:22 

23:22 kind of institutionalize mentorship I
23:25 

23:25 assign like an older uh like a more
23:27 

23:27 experienced employee to a younger uh
23:30 

23:30 employee so that they can share work
23:32 

23:32 experiences together but Tak it in real
23:34 

23:34 life actually we all are experiencing
23:37 

23:37 mentorships of some way of form um
23:40 

23:40 through communicating with others um one
23:42 

23:42 through the way we like make friends
23:44 

23:44 with others and learn from them I like
23:46 

23:46 what you said about like you also look
23:47 

23:47 up to people who don't know that you're
23:49 

23:49 a Mente but actually it's mentorship at
23:52 

23:52 scale for them you know it it's teaching
23:55 

23:55 uh they're they're trying to teach to a
23:56 

23:56 wider pool of people recognizing that
23:58 

23:58 they're experiences um might not just
24:00 

24:00 benefit just one mentee but many so
24:03 

24:03 they're trying to use medians um like
24:05 

24:05 these uh influencing uh platforms to
24:08 

24:08 share this knowledge at large um and you
24:11 

24:11 know even in this conversation it could
24:13 

24:13 Loosely be be labeled as some sort of
24:15 

24:15 mentorship as well we're sharing this
24:17 

24:17 this is this is us sharing knowledge
24:20 

24:20 with each each other and actually I was
24:22 

24:22 kind of thinking like At first I
24:24 

24:24 classified as you are more likely to be
24:26 

24:26 a mentor than both of us and we're
24:28 

24:28 likely to be in the process of searching
24:29 

24:29 for mentors but I reflected on it I I
24:32 

24:32 wouldn't categorize myself in any of
24:34 

24:34 those binaries cuz you're also saying
24:36 

24:36 that I'm not intention intentionally
24:38 

24:38 looking for a mentor but I'm look I'm
24:40 

24:40 still looking out for people I can learn
24:42 

24:42 from you know so in this process yeah we
24:45 

24:45 shouldn't Park ourselves in that binary
24:47 

24:47 Mentor mentee we shouldn't Park
24:48 

24:48 ourselves um in terms of like one uh
24:51 

24:51 Mentor one mentee it's always us looking
24:54 

24:54 for diverse opinions to learn from and I
24:57 

24:57 yeah actually
24:58 

24:58 you know that that was quite a
24:60 

24:60 breakthrough in my head through this
25:01 

25:01 conversation yeah and what you mentioned
25:03 

25:03 actually also reminds me of this saying
25:05 

25:05 like it takes a village to raise a child
25:07 

25:07 well it takes a community to grow a
25:10 

25:10 person as well
25:14 

25:14 so I don't know I just I just I just
25:17 

25:17 apply that to a bigger scale but yeah I
25:19 

25:19 think it's true like we all learn from
25:21 

25:21 like various people that we meet
25:22 

25:22 throughout our lives like that makes us
25:24 

25:24 a part of who we are like just by
25:26 

25:26 interacting with people every day we
25:28 

25:28 actually learn something like maybe even
25:30 

25:30 subconsciously we learn things from them
25:32 

25:32 so yeah like you mentioned it's not
25:34 

25:34 something binary and also I love how
25:37 

25:37 when sonone mentioned that uh she don't
25:39 

25:39 want really the accountability thing oh
25:42 

25:42 like maybe that's why I also like when
25:45 

25:45 in navigating my career I also just want
25:47 

25:47 to have the freedom to explore it myself
25:50 

25:50 make some mistakes myself you know I
25:52 

25:52 think a lot of people they're scared of
25:53 

25:53 falling down but you know like sometimes
25:56 

25:56 you you got to fall down so you know you
25:58 

25:58 learn how to get back up so that is
26:00 

26:00 something that I wanted to do and maybe
26:03 

26:03 that's why I just I just you know try
26:06 

26:06 everything yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure
26:09 

26:09 yeah oh no actually I I was um the last
26:14 

26:14 uh point I had uh was uh actually more
26:18 

26:18 of uh I also through this process don't
26:20 

26:20 want to invalidate people who are
26:22 

26:22 looking for mentors you know cuz I um
26:25 

26:25 different people are different there
26:26 

26:26 could be something you know you want to
26:28 

26:28 get to or you definitely want this
26:31 

26:31 person's path and then I would
26:34 

26:34 definitely encourage that if you have
26:35 

26:35 found a person you want to be for sure
26:38 

26:38 then you should seek that person as a
26:41 

26:41 like a official Mentor have have uh
26:44 

26:44 frequent meetings and you know catch up
26:47 

26:47 or if some people like to be accountable
26:49 

26:49 right yeah they want like structure they
26:51 

26:51 want accountability correct so then
26:54 

26:54 there is also that we are not saying
26:56 

26:56 that's no no don't do that m that's
26:58 

26:58 another person's opinion another
27:00 

27:00 person's way of working so and uh like
27:04 

27:04 we are part of women code we are going
27:06 

27:06 to be doing more mentorship programs yes
27:09 

27:09 definely not invalidating yeah so we are
27:11 

27:11 definitely I personally uh am very happy
27:14 

27:14 to like make people match up where they
27:16 

27:16 can find some uh guidance through their
27:19 

27:19 career or like it could be even a short
27:22 

27:22 thing where can you help me get a job
27:25 

27:25 can you help me switch into Tech it
27:26 

27:26 could just be a short uh shortterm thing
27:29 

27:29 for example so uh I I would like someone
27:33 

27:33 if I ever figure out what a shortterm
27:35 

27:35 thing I want and if I can find someone
27:36 

27:36 who can mentor me I would definitely
27:38 

27:38 love that as well yeah yeah and in know
27:40 

27:40 way it's it's more of like um I we we
27:43 

27:43 acknowledge our privileged circumstance
27:45 

27:45 that you know our personalities have
27:47 

27:47 allowed us to be more exploratory in
27:49 

27:49 nature and to see the world in this way
27:51 

27:51 where in communities where we're exposed
27:54 

27:54 to many many people that we can learn
27:55 

27:55 from but a lot of people don't start
27:57 

27:57 from that that same Landing point and
27:59 

27:59 that's why we create these programs to
28:01 

28:01 start them off um uh with um like you
28:04 

28:04 talk to this person and you talk to this
28:05 

28:05 person because a lot of people can't
28:07 

28:07 even take that first step because of
28:10 

28:10 their uh external circumstances because
28:12 

28:12 of the way that they've been brought up
28:13 

28:13 so many different reasons but I think
28:15 

28:15 how we see the mentorship program is uh
28:18 

28:18 or like any mentorship program that
28:19 

28:19 we're in it's more of we give you the
28:21 

28:21 starting point here's like One Mentor
28:23 

28:23 but we hope that um people will
28:25 

28:25 eventually come to uh their own
28:27 

28:27 conclusion that wait I don't have to
28:28 

28:28 just stick to this moment or wait
28:30 

28:30 there's also this other person that's
28:32 

28:32 why it's a mentorship program right
28:33 

28:33 you're also showing that look these are
28:35 

28:35 all the different people you could learn
28:36 

28:36 from for now you can learn from start
28:38 

28:38 with uh this one person but you can talk
28:39 

28:39 to this other one you can talk to this
28:41 

28:41 other one and you know as we talk about
28:43 

28:43 how mentorship it's not about us telling
28:45 

28:45 you exactly what to do even in this
28:47 

28:47 conversation we're obviously not telling
28:49 

28:49 everybody like don't seek out mentorship
28:51 

28:51 this is our experience and our Journeys
28:53 

28:53 realizing that mentorship is not binary
28:56 

28:56 it's not singular and we share sharing
28:58 

28:58 that experience hoping that that seats a
28:60 

28:60 thought in somebody else's head but
29:02 

29:02 we're also not prescribing it because
29:03 

29:03 you know everybody's experiences are
29:05 

29:05 different and definitely and just to add
29:07 

29:07 on to that like everyone's journey is
29:08 

29:08 different so some people mentorship is
29:10 

29:10 just a part of that Journey so even if
29:12 

29:12 someone is still in their exploratory
29:15 

29:15 kind of stage they might seek out
29:17 

29:17 mentorship just so that they can get
29:19 

29:19 exposed to like that area of tech and
29:21 

29:21 like realize maybe that's not for them
29:23 

29:23 maybe that is for them so it really
29:26 

29:26 depends like you mentioned on their
29:28 

29:28 personality and what they want from the
29:30 

29:30 mentorship program and that's why once
29:32 

29:32 again I emphasize like if you are if you
29:34 

29:34 are seeking mentorship then you need to
29:36 

29:36 be clear like what do you want out of
29:38 

29:38 the mentorship so that you know you
29:40 

29:40 don't feel lost during the whole process
29:43 

29:43 the whole program in fact yeah so it can
29:47 

29:47 be for anyone and it's just something
29:50 

29:50 that we have to try yeah exactly exactly
29:52 

29:52 you wouldn't know unless you try it out
29:54 

29:54 so definitely try things yeah yeah for
29:57 

29:57 sure well I think that was a really
29:59 

29:59 beautiful conclusion to this topic I
30:01 

30:01 actually didn't realize we would come to
30:02 

30:02 this point in the sense where we started
30:05 

30:05 with like mentorship because a lot of
30:06 

30:06 people like requested for it but then
30:08 

30:08 realizing that our own views of on
30:10 

30:10 mentorship is um convergent amongst us
30:14 

30:14 but also acknowledging that like um
30:16 

30:16 that's uh not a view that anybody uh
30:19 

30:19 needs to have also um but yeah I think
30:23 

30:23 that was a really good wrap up in terms
30:25 

30:25 of uh how we View mentorship and how um
30:27 

30:27 um we also like uh construct programs to
30:31 

30:31 connect people together like that role
30:32 

30:32 is very important as well uh through our
30:34 

30:34 experiences in women and code and for
30:36 

30:36 all three of us right here this is also
30:38 

30:38 our way of sharing knowledge um both to
30:40 

30:40 each other and hopefully to the world
30:42 

30:42 through the medium of this video podcast
