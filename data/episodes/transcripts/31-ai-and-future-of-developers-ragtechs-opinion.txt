00:01 [Music]
00:04 

00:04 Hello everybody. Welcome to Rack Tag.
00:07 

00:07 This is a place where we talk about real
00:08 

00:08 life topics in tech, otherwise known as
00:10 

00:10 bites and banter. I'm Natasha. I'm a
00:12 

00:12 software engineer. I'm Salon, software
00:15 

00:15 developer. And I'm Victoria, a solutions
00:17 

00:17 engineer. And today's episode will be
00:19 

00:19 all about AI and the future of
00:22 

00:22 developers. So we often hear this common
00:25 

00:25 kind of fear-mongering rhetoric
00:27 

00:27 especially with the launch of uh open AI
00:29 

00:29 and chat GBT that AI is going to replace
00:32 

00:32 developers and specifically uh they say
00:35 

00:35 that AI is going to replace junior
00:37 

00:37 developers. So we're all seated here
00:40 

00:40 today uh and I think we've been thinking
00:42 

00:42 about this topic for quite a while
00:43 

00:43 because it's quite a common question
00:45 

00:45 that's thrown to us uh since we're in
00:47 

00:47 the field. So I wanted to throw it out
00:50 

00:50 there and I wanted to throw the question
00:51 

00:51 to Salon first because Salon is a senior
00:53 

00:53 software developer who has uh engaged
00:56 

00:56 with a lot of junior developers. So do
00:58 

00:58 you think that AI will replace junior
00:60 

00:60 developers?
01:02 

01:02 I don't know if it can replace replace
01:04 

01:04 but yes it does do a lot of things. uh
01:06 

01:06 it can already do a lot of things that
01:08 

01:08 you would give tasks that you would give
01:11 

01:11 a junior developer but also actually
01:13 

01:13 recently someone asked me this question
01:15 

01:15 and I replied it's actually the AI is
01:18 

01:18 not only going to replace junior de it's
01:20 

01:20 actually now a midlevel developer
01:22 

01:22 already no yes it's it's getting to the
01:25 

01:25 senior developer already actually but of
01:28 

01:28 course I mean a developer I I think
01:30 

01:30 we've talked about this developer is not
01:32 

01:32 just about someone who can code it's
01:34 

01:34 also like a product engineer senior
01:37 

01:37 position now, right? You don't only have
01:39 

01:39 to given this task, write the code for
01:42 

01:42 it. You should also be questioning why
01:44 

01:44 are we building this feature? Why are we
01:46 

01:46 fixing this bug? Is it even a bug? How
01:49 

01:49 many people are impacted by this bug,
01:51 

01:51 this feature, should I make it this way,
01:53 

01:53 that way? So it's it's not just
01:55 

01:55 developer is software developer is not
01:58 

01:58 just about coding coding which is right
01:59 

01:59 now what uh code copilot and like the
02:02 

02:02 other coding uh AI does for us. So I
02:08 

02:08 wouldn't say it will totally totally
02:09 

02:09 replace us but it will aid us definitely
02:11 

02:11 it makes me uh definitely a much more
02:15 

02:15 faster developer. I I am able to debug
02:18 

02:18 things a lot more quickly. Like those
02:20 

02:20 underlying stuff, I wouldn't even like
02:22 

02:22 uh hover over and see what the issue is.
02:24 

02:24 I'll just like copilot fix it for me
02:27 

02:27 now. It has that fix me now button fix
02:30 

02:30 it now. It usually works. I mean
02:32 

02:32 sometime goes into this rabbit hole but
02:35 

02:35 uh rare cases. So what you are saying is
02:38 

02:38 that uh firstly that a developer's job
02:41 

02:41 is not just purely about writing code.
02:44 

02:44 Yeah, it's also a lot about how you work
02:46 

02:46 and collaborate in a team and also
02:49 

02:49 product mind mind and having a product
02:52 

02:52 mindset being knowing how to prioritize
02:54 

02:54 certain features and how to like and
02:56 

02:56 which fe yeah prioritize features and
02:58 

02:58 also if it's valuable
03:02 

03:02 because value I would say is quite
03:04 

03:04 subjective right that's why there's the
03:06 

03:06 whole notion of like say value
03:07 

03:07 engineering in product teams how do you
03:10 

03:10 like value one feature over another one
03:12 

03:12 bug fix over another I guess you could
03:14 

03:14 technically use like co-pilot or any AI
03:17 

03:17 agent to basically tell you like the
03:19 

03:19 pros and cons but at the end of the day
03:21 

03:21 the person who makes the decision is the
03:23 

03:23 developer in the team like our group of
03:25 

03:25 developers right exactly and in light of
03:28 

03:28 this I guess if what we're saying here
03:31 

03:31 is that a developer is more than just
03:32 

03:32 code and now that code can be made more
03:35 

03:35 efficient by AI we should be focused on
03:37 

03:37 focusing on maybe the other aspects the
03:39 

03:39 team aspects so what kind of advice vice
03:42 

03:42 do you have both of you do you have to
03:44 

03:44 give to junior developers entry- level
03:47 

03:47 developers who are coming into this uh
03:49 

03:49 role now that they might have to focus
03:51 

03:51 more on the soft skills I think I would
03:54 

03:54 agree with salon in terms of you just
03:56 

03:56 don't think about writing code but think
03:58 

03:58 of the end user who's also using that
04:01 

04:01 application who is actually also um
04:04 

04:04 experiencing like using the app so given
04:08 

04:08 my experience as a solutions engineer
04:10 

04:10 it's always important to also have the
04:12 

04:12 business acumen. So thinking about what
04:14 

04:14 does the client wants, what does the
04:16 

04:16 customer wants. So not just the end user
04:19 

04:19 but the client who's like actually
04:21 

04:21 engaging your services to build the
04:23 

04:23 solution for you. So sometimes
04:25 

04:25 optimizing code doesn't mean it's
04:27 

04:27 optimizing for the business. So you have
04:29 

04:29 to think about cost benefit as well. Um
04:32 

04:32 being able to weigh that as a skill. I
04:35 

04:35 think over time because for me I've been
04:37 

04:37 experimenting a lot with coding AI
04:39 

04:39 solutions and just comparing like a few
04:41 

04:41 tools I can already say that these
04:44 

04:44 coding AI solutions are already pretty
04:46 

04:46 good for junior developers and even like
04:50 

04:50 present day junior developers I've met a
04:52 

04:52 lot who are still just struggling with
04:55 

04:55 writing basic code and then I realized
04:59 

04:59 that these coding tools are actually
05:01 

05:01 like even slightly better in a way
05:03 

05:03 because you can actually tell them if
05:06 

05:06 you're really good at prompt engineering
05:07 

05:07 which I've like experimented throughout
05:10 

05:10 a few years is like once you give the
05:12 

05:12 coding AI solution enough context enough
05:15 

05:15 good uh information they can actually
05:17 

05:17 write pretty solid ones but I always say
05:20 

05:20 the AI tool is only as good as the
05:22 

05:22 prompter. Ah yeah that's why so you are
05:25 

05:25 given the prom. It's actually as smart
05:26 

05:26 as you. Oh okay. Yeah tell it the right
05:29 

05:29 things like refactor it use these design
05:32 

05:32 patterns. It will do exactly what you
05:33 

05:33 asked it to do but you asked it to do
05:35 

05:35 it. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, this is a
05:38 

05:38 really important point because I was
05:40 

05:40 just I was helping out my brother uh who
05:43 

05:43 was doing coding coding module and um he
05:47 

05:47 tried basically plastering the entire
05:49 

05:49 like um the the homework assignment into
05:52 

05:52 chatbt and then it comes out with like
05:55 

05:55 an answer, right? But his next question
05:57 

05:57 to me was where does this fit in the
05:59 

05:59 code? Where does it fit anywhere? How do
06:01 

06:01 I even utilize this code that chat GBT
06:04 

06:04 just told me? And I realized like it
06:06 

06:06 really goes back to the um the AI um
06:10 

06:10 agent is only as good as like the
06:11 

06:11 prompter. And as the prompter or as the
06:13 

06:13 developer in this case, you still need
06:15 

06:15 your basic fundamentals to know where
06:17 

06:17 code fits. You know, you it should be
06:20 

06:20 easy. Yeah, this is the homework. Solve
06:21 

06:21 this. But also tell me how to run it.
06:24 

06:24 Yeah, but you need you need to be able
06:26 

06:26 to write the words. Tell me how to run
06:27 

06:27 it. If you don't even know the concept
06:29 

06:29 of running a program in the first place
06:31 

06:31 and then you also have to give other
06:33 

06:33 context. I'm using uh I'm using this on
06:35 

06:35 terminal. I'm using this on PowerShell.
06:37 

06:37 How do I run it on these uh terminals or
06:39 

06:39 whatever? Like you need to know the
06:41 

06:41 context of the environment that you're
06:42 

06:42 working in in order to prompt and later
06:44 

06:44 specify that context you're in. And
06:47 

06:47 often times you might uh run into
06:49 

06:49 occasions where the um the the AI
06:52 

06:52 solution gives you a wrong answer.
06:54 

06:54 Actually, that happens quite a lot. It
06:56 

06:56 could either be hallucinations or it
06:58 

06:58 just like it misinterpreted your
07:00 

07:00 question completely. M so if you're not
07:03 

07:03 able to understand the context and also
07:06 

07:06 the fundamentals, how are you going to
07:07 

07:07 tell when the AI solution tells you
07:10 

07:10 something wrong? You're just going to be
07:12 

07:12 taking the code and then oh it doesn't
07:13 

07:13 run. Why? The troubleshooting process
07:16 

07:16 which I feel like is one of the most
07:18 

07:18 important uh skills that a developer
07:20 

07:20 learns which is troubleshooting uh as
07:22 

07:22 you go um is about asking the right
07:25 

07:25 questions even when you don't know the
07:27 

07:27 answer to it. And I think that as a
07:29 

07:29 whole like is is a soft skill that a
07:32 

07:32 developer should learn and can actually
07:34 

07:34 learn quite well if you're using um uh
07:36 

07:36 these AI solutions because you're
07:38 

07:38 training yourself to ask the right
07:40 

07:40 questions explicitly. Yes. Exactly. I've
07:42 

07:42 actually heard uh advice that junior
07:45 

07:45 developers like uh those who are trying
07:47 

07:47 to get a job entry- level jobs they
07:49 

07:49 should not use uh AI tools because that
07:52 

07:52 kind of takes away the without AI tools.
07:56 

07:56 We have grown up without AI tools as
07:58 

07:58 entry level. We had to practice,
07:60 

07:60 practice, practice. Yeah. So they
08:02 

08:02 actually removing that portion away from
08:04 

08:04 themselves, practicing debugging
08:06 

08:06 themselves than just ask for help, you
08:08 

08:08 know. That's why when I was interviewing
08:10 

08:10 cuz I was trying to hire some junior
08:12 

08:12 devs. I was interviewing and I noticed
08:14 

08:14 they their eyes are not like on the
08:16 

08:16 camera. They're clearly looking a lot of
08:19 

08:19 them are clearly reading off something,
08:21 

08:21 right? So if I asked them like a basic
08:24 

08:24 question on React like like explain to
08:26 

08:26 me the use state hook right they
08:29 

08:29 couldn't even give me a proper answer
08:32 

08:32 like they just reciting off some script
08:34 

08:34 that doesn't make much sense and then I
08:37 

08:37 say can you elaborate and they will be
08:38 

08:38 like yeah that that's all I have. So a
08:42 

08:42 lot of I feel like new entry people now
08:45 

08:45 they're already so over reliant on AI
08:48 

08:48 tools that they like you mentioned they
08:51 

08:51 don't have this practice and they're
08:52 

08:52 unable to form their own opinions. So
08:54 

08:54 like like let's say I'm interviewing for
08:56 

08:56 a mid level as well. So they should be
08:59 

08:59 able to form their own opinions in terms
09:00 

09:00 of design like system design and
09:02 

09:02 everything. They couldn't they couldn't
09:05 

09:05 give me like I wouldn't say all but some
09:07 

09:07 of them that I've interviewed like a
09:08 

09:08 good amount they couldn't give me a
09:11 

09:11 proper answer they will be clearly
09:14 

09:14 either reading it off somewhere or they
09:18 

09:18 just they really cannot answer right so
09:20 

09:20 that's what I noticed is the over
09:23 

09:23 reliant of AI tools you need to be able
09:26 

09:26 to still make your own judgment and
09:28 

09:28 decisions I think that's a huge part
09:30 

09:30 that would like help you stand out among
09:33 

09:33 other engineers. No, that's true because
09:35 

09:35 it's like before the age of AI when we
09:38 

09:38 had to troubleshoot things, we often
09:39 

09:39 always go down a rabbit hole, right? And
09:41 

09:41 it's always these rabbit holes that
09:43 

09:43 leads us to the deep dark answer to like
09:45 

09:45 now I'm trying to figure out how the
09:47 

09:47 hardware of a computer works because I'm
09:48 

09:48 trying to like I don't know tap into the
09:50 

09:50 GPU whatever that's how you kind of like
09:53 

09:53 from your basic let's say you're a web
09:56 

09:56 application engineer. you're supposed to
09:58 

09:58 be just writing say front end code but
10:00 

10:00 somehow you end up like becoming sort of
10:03 

10:03 a cloud engineer to some point where
10:04 

10:04 you're trying to find out how come when
10:06 

10:06 I deploy this on my uh uh local uh
10:09 

10:09 environment it works but now the cloud
10:11 

10:11 side is telling me it doesn't deploy and
10:13 

10:13 that's how you learn that's how you
10:14 

10:14 troubleshoot but the thing is like with
10:16 

10:16 co-pilot chat GBT you're so used to I
10:19 

10:19 face a problem I'm going to get an
10:21 

10:21 answer straight away from like the AI um
10:24 

10:24 tool that I'm using that you never go
10:26 

10:26 down these rabbit hole anymore. So
10:29 

10:29 without these rabbit holes, you never
10:30 

10:30 discover the fundamentals. And I think
10:32 

10:32 that's what I've also noticed out of
10:35 

10:35 like entry- level engineers or 2B
10:37 

10:37 engineers these days that they don't
10:39 

10:39 they're very good at like the high level
10:41 

10:41 frameworks concepts. But when it comes
10:44 

10:44 to like down to the very low level
10:46 

10:46 asking them to explain what a framework
10:49 

10:49 is for example like they know how to use
10:50 

10:50 React sure but do you know React is
10:52 

10:52 built upon of like um the very basic
10:55 

10:55 JavaScript HTML CSS do you know the
10:58 

10:58 interconnection between that because you
10:59 

10:59 they've never gone down that rabbit hole
11:01 

11:01 so they aren't able to answer that and I
11:03 

11:03 find that that they don't see the need
11:06 

11:06 to understand at a deeper level they're
11:08 

11:08 like why do I need to know these stuff
11:10 

11:10 why you asking me these questions as
11:12 

11:12 long as I know how to use this
11:14 

11:14 framework. Isn't that enough? Yeah. So,
11:16 

11:16 I would say that's arguable. We can
11:18 

11:18 argue that day-to-day job you don't need
11:20 

11:20 to know like at a fundamental level. But
11:23 

11:23 like you mentioned, troubleshooting is
11:25 

11:25 part of the learning process and knowing
11:27 

11:27 how to uh troubleshoot is also a skill.
11:31 

11:31 So, it's like if you understand it
11:33 

11:33 deeper, you can actually come up with
11:36 

11:36 more creative solutions. All right? M
11:38 

11:38 that's why I think understanding
11:40 

11:40 something at a deeper level is always
11:42 

11:42 beneficial than not right but it's not
11:45 

11:45 like I will totally reject this person
11:46 

11:46 if they don't understand like all that
11:49 

11:49 like but it's just like it just gives me
11:52 

11:52 a more um like that impression that you
11:55 

11:55 might be able to actually accelerate
11:58 

11:58 like your career to the next level
12:00 

12:00 faster because you have that
12:02 

12:02 understanding and in the future if
12:04 

12:04 there's like more junior developers that
12:06 

12:06 come in I can see that you stand out
12:09 

12:09 above the rest if you have that. Yeah.
12:12 

12:12 So that's my take on it essentially. I'm
12:15 

12:15 curious about and I guess like there's
12:18 

12:18 also the whole notion that AI cannot
12:20 

12:20 replace junior developers because if
12:22 

12:22 they if it does replace junior
12:24 

12:24 developers then we won't have senior
12:26 

12:26 developers in the future, right? It's a
12:28 

12:28 pyramid. Yeah. Now that you have junior
12:30 

12:30 developers coming on board on your team
12:33 

12:33 and you know that they're going to use
12:34 

12:34 like AI tools, how would you change your
12:37 

12:37 way of like mentoring and guiding a
12:39 

12:39 junior developer to to kind of like
12:42 

12:42 teach them the skill of like, hey, don't
12:44 

12:44 rely on your AI tools so much. This is
12:47 

12:47 what you should do and this is what I
12:48 

12:48 used to do as a a junior developer to
12:51 

12:51 get to where I am. I actually uh like
12:53 

12:53 fortunately I actually have not seen
12:55 

12:55 anyone over reliant on AI yet and also
12:58 

12:58 because uh companies nowadays we have
13:00 

13:00 like tools in place where you're not
13:03 

13:03 allowed to use chat GPT you have to use
13:05 

13:05 the in-house tooling and things like
13:07 

13:07 that so that kind of limits it's not as
13:09 

13:09 free and open as the chat GPT outside
13:13 

13:13 and also copilot maybe there's some
13:15 

13:15 licenses you don't people use it don't
13:18 

13:18 use it so I was actually shocked that
13:19 

13:19 people are not using AI as much as I
13:21 

13:21 would I would think but I think for
13:24 

13:24 junior developers it's okay fine you can
13:27 

13:27 use AI tools if it if you know how to
13:30 

13:30 use it properly you're becoming a better
13:32 

13:32 prompter that's good also but also I
13:34 

13:34 would say on the side maybe try
13:37 

13:37 entrepreneurship because that will give
13:39 

13:39 you like yeah you can dip your toes into
13:41 

13:41 product oh like product world and like
13:44 

13:44 yeah and what are different departments
13:46 

13:46 and like uh how to see big higher level
13:49 

13:49 picture of products uh the way things
13:52 

13:52 work together. Engineering itself from
13:54 

13:54 like a bigger like a higher level
13:57 

13:57 perspective. It forces you to try every
13:59 

13:59 single role like you have you can't just
14:01 

14:01 be a front-end engineer you have to do
14:03 

14:03 back end you have to deploy you have to
14:05 

14:05 do all these other things. So in that in
14:07 

14:07 essence if you try out entrepreneurship
14:09 

14:09 on the side or as even your primary if
14:12 

14:12 you want to try a startup you end up
14:13 

14:13 like learning the I think that's kind of
14:16 

14:16 the only way out for those who are not
14:18 

14:18 able to get jobs. I think the job market
14:20 

14:20 has has changed a bit. Interviews are
14:23 

14:23 getting a little bit different now. I
14:25 

14:25 think also because as interviewer we can
14:28 

14:28 also detect like okay people are
14:30 

14:30 actually referencing something else. So
14:32 

14:32 we change our questions you know we give
14:33 

14:33 a different question each time. We
14:35 

14:35 questions also catered to how well you
14:38 

14:38 have troubleshooted your previous
14:39 

14:39 projects maybe you know those kind of
14:41 

14:41 questions. So that so we have also have
14:43 

14:43 to adapt to find the the better
14:46 

14:46 developers out there and then uh we
14:49 

14:49 should encourage the usage of AI tools
14:51 

14:51 because it does increase productivity
14:53 

14:53 but also monitor and you know make sure
14:57 

14:57 it's going in the right path and as a
14:59 

14:59 senior developer I also am using all
15:01 

15:01 these tools to make sure that even I am
15:05 

15:05 getting more productive and as I said
15:08 

15:08 the the AI2 is as good as the prompter
15:10 

15:10 if I am replacing
15:12 

15:12 maybe not a junior like an intern with
15:14 

15:14 this AI tool. I should be able to give
15:17 

15:17 correct instructions and ensure I am
15:20 

15:20 giving the right domain the context and
15:23 

15:23 everything to this tool to produce the
15:25 

15:25 work that I want. Yeah. And I just
15:28 

15:28 realized that mid-level to senior level
15:31 

15:31 developers and even like higher down
15:32 

15:32 when you go down the managerial track
15:34 

15:34 really stand to benefit from AI tools
15:36 

15:36 because there prior to like chat GPT and
15:38 

15:38 all these things there's always been a
15:40 

15:40 struggle of balancing how much of the
15:42 

15:42 people work and managerial work you do
15:44 

15:44 versus the coding work you do and they
15:46 

15:46 say like when you go down to managerial
15:47 

15:47 it's 20% code and then 80% like people
15:50 

15:50 management and people you know when you
15:52 

15:52 decide between these tracks you're
15:53 

15:53 always debating within yourself. I want
15:55 

15:55 to I still want to code but I also want
15:56 

15:56 to go up like the management ranks. But
15:59 

15:59 with like AI tools now you that it might
16:02 

16:02 not be a 20 80% anymore. You're able to
16:04 

16:04 complete more uh uh coding tasks with
16:07 

16:07 the help of AI while at the same time
16:09 

16:09 dedicate the uh time that you otherwise
16:12 

16:12 would have spent like I don't know
16:13 

16:13 debugging or figuring out syntax on the
16:15 

16:15 people management. So maybe it might
16:17 

16:17 level that out to a 50/50
16:20 

16:20 if you use it properly. If you use it
16:22 

16:22 properly. Yeah. Yeah. That's a skill.
16:24 

16:24 Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a skill in
16:26 

16:26 itself. You learn it properly. Exactly.
16:28 

16:28 Something that you have to train and
16:29 

16:29 find your own rabbit holes.
