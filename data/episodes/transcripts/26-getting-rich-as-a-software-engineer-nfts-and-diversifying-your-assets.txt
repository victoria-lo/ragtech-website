00:01 in our last episode with Martin a
00:03 

00:03 retired software engineer and startup
00:05 

00:05 founder sonone and I got to understand
00:07 

00:07 more about his journey investing into
00:09 

00:09 Bitcoin in this episode we continue to
00:12 

00:12 explore his financial world view such as
00:14 

00:14 his views on the commonly perceived
00:16 

00:16 wealth of software engineers and startup
00:18 

00:18 Founders his opinions on nfts and views
00:21 

00:21 on asset
00:24 

00:24 [Music]
00:27 

00:27 diversification so it's it's interesting
00:29 

00:29 how our re engineer was not uh it was
00:33 

00:33 not rich like from from
00:37 

00:37 engineering even though that is actually
00:39 

00:39 very frustrating it feels uh I've wasted
00:43 

00:43 20 years of my career and it it didn't
00:46 

00:46 amount to anything it kind of feels like
00:48 

00:48 that right I me you do I mean I did all
00:51 

00:51 the community stuff and open source
00:53 

00:53 Library so there is something there but
00:55 

00:55 I mean I would really have preferred to
00:57 

00:57 have that one startup exit you know when
00:59 

00:59 I came to Singapore that was 13 years
01:01 

01:01 ago there were uh hackathons at night
01:04 

01:04 everywhere there were VCS running around
01:06 

01:06 throwing parties all the time uh it was
01:09 

01:09 really bustling and the the VC money was
01:13 

01:13 flowing from the sky like Mana you know
01:16 

01:16 and um but still most startups actually
01:18 

01:18 fail 99% of all startups fail and this
01:21 

01:21 is really true and it's so frustrating
01:23 

01:23 right all the code that we've written
01:25 

01:25 for nothing it's all Gone Gone With the
01:27 

01:27 Wind I'm glad that you brought this up
01:30 

01:30 because I you know we've talked about
01:32 

01:32 startups in other episodes before and um
01:34 

01:34 Tech is also very closely related to the
01:36 

01:36 startup Community as you can see um but
01:39 

01:39 I think the notion that people have
01:40 

01:40 about people in tech people in startups
01:42 

01:42 is that oh you must be earning big money
01:45 

01:45 yeah that is a stereotype it's not
01:47 

01:47 necessarily true in fact majority of the
01:49 

01:49 time it's not true um if you do see like
01:52 

01:52 an example of somebody who's retired
01:53 

01:53 early and stuff like that kind of like
01:55 

01:55 Martin it's not necessarily because of
01:58 

01:58 like a shirt out or because that we're
01:59 

01:59 software Engineers or whatsoever um a
02:02 

02:02 lot of us are just like average people
02:04 

02:04 just trying to get by but we very
02:06 

02:06 resourceful means of um using our money
02:10 

02:10 uh investing our money so that's
02:12 

02:12 something that we really would like to
02:13 

02:13 emphasize that it's a stereotype that
02:15 

02:15 we're all rich in this field yeah yeah
02:17 

02:17 and and I guess um even though Singapore
02:21 

02:21 tries to be the Silicon Valley of Asia
02:23 

02:23 sast Asia and so on and um you know
02:26 

02:26 there is still a busting startup scene I
02:28 

02:28 believe um I be very careful with
02:31 

02:31 betting your future wealth on your
02:34 

02:34 shares like making an exit and and then
02:36 

02:36 there's Texas and all and there's
02:37 

02:37 dilution and everything you don't even
02:39 

02:39 know how much you get end out at the
02:40 

02:40 very end right even if it's a successful
02:42 

02:42 exit you might end up with very little
02:44 

02:44 um you need to have a plan B like my my
02:47 

02:47 my work at artling was always artling a
02:51 

02:51 plan a
02:52 

02:52 oh and I mean it could still happen I
02:55 

02:55 mean the company is not gone right the
02:56 

02:56 company is still growing Plan B Bitcoin
02:58 

02:58 and plan B is Bitcoin yeah exactly was
03:00 

03:00 my plan B right um so see my
03:04 

03:04 child we'll go into that
03:06 

03:06 later yeah but definitely I I like that
03:10 

03:10 notion that there's always plan a b and
03:12 

03:12 c I think people get very stuck on like
03:13 

03:13 there is only this one means of like
03:16 

03:16 getting rich getting successful but
03:18 

03:18 really it's a life can go in very
03:20 

03:20 unexpected ways there is no sure win for
03:22 

03:22 anything we're all taking bets here kind
03:24 

03:24 of like better on Bitcoin in a way and I
03:25 

03:25 guess then you could say a word about
03:27 

03:27 diversification right so my startup
03:30 

03:30 Journey plan a is one asset people might
03:34 

03:34 think oh I just put money into many many
03:36 

03:36 startups but maybe they are all actually
03:38 

03:38 related correlated to each other if the
03:40 

03:40 economy goes down the VC money dries up
03:42 

03:42 all startups die right and then there's
03:44 

03:44 no there's no diversification Happening
03:46 

03:46 Here If you put all your X on these
03:49 

03:49 asset types they will all die
03:52 

03:52 simultaneously right Bitcoin is
03:54 

03:54 completely separate from that right so
03:56 

03:56 if maybe the startup scene dies down
03:58 

03:58 maybe the crypto Scene goes up right so
04:00 

04:00 and then people say oh in the crypto
04:03 

04:03 scene you have to diversify you have to
04:04 

04:04 buy all these other I call them
04:06 

04:06 shitcoins right I don't believe in in
04:08 

04:08 any other I have never touched any other
04:10 

04:10 crypto coin and yeah cardano whatever um
04:14 

04:14 I would not touch them it's basically
04:17 

04:17 literally gambling I me they all go up
04:19 

04:19 but then they go down and they never
04:20 

04:20 come back up again that's the problem
04:21 

04:21 except ethereum and one guy can actually
04:23 

04:23 uh change the F of it exactly yeah yeah
04:28 

04:28 um yeah so um you cannot diversify
04:31 

04:31 within the crypto world if you spread
04:33 

04:33 your money you know you made lots of
04:35 

04:35 money with Bitcoin then you spread it to
04:37 

04:37 like 100 different coins it's still
04:39 

04:39 gambling and they all move in tendem
04:41 

04:41 with Bitcoin so if Bitcoin goes down
04:43 

04:43 they all go down as well so where's the
04:44 

04:44 diversification in that right so like
04:47 

04:47 you said like property is probably a
04:48 

04:48 good thing do building something is a
04:51 

04:51 good thing startups right and then in
04:53 

04:53 using some investment vehicle like ETS
04:55 

04:55 or Rec coin or whatever is a good thing
04:57 

04:57 art might be a good thing but I mean I'm
05:00 

05:00 in the art
05:02 

05:02 industry very
05:05 

05:05 difficult yeah sure yeah okay an sorry
05:08 

05:08 about your the art link is it a web
05:11 

05:11 agency or is it a art it's it's we are
05:15 

05:15 basically the probably the world's
05:17 

05:17 largest database for contemporary art so
05:21 

05:21 um our the artists can make a profile
05:23 

05:23 and they list their works and then if
05:25 

05:25 somebody buys the art the artist will
05:26 

05:26 Shi to that person so we don't hold
05:27 

05:27 inventory okay and um yeah we we spent
05:31 

05:31 10 years onboarding all these artists
05:34 

05:34 and cating so it's like not everybody
05:36 

05:36 can list so uh and the our cators are
05:40 

05:40 trained art historian like uh they they
05:43 

05:43 went to University and learned
05:44 

05:44 everything about art they know what
05:45 

05:45 they're doing so um yeah we have like an
05:48 

05:48 amazing collection of really really good
05:50 

05:50 art and um we have Consultants that know
05:53 

05:53 how to pull of big art projects so many
05:57 

05:57 many hotels here in Singapore and all
05:59 

05:59 over the world and Sydney as well on the
06:01 

06:01 Maldives they actually buy their art
06:03 

06:03 from us so when the new hotel opens they
06:06 

06:06 need like you know we need 5,000
06:07 

06:07 artworks for like all these rooms uh and
06:10 

06:10 then we we try to find something that
06:12 

06:12 suits their budget and their style that
06:14 

06:14 they want to have yeah so since you're
06:16 

06:16 in this field is Art also one form of
06:19 

06:19 investment vehicle for you sort of like
06:21 

06:21 a plan I don't know what no
06:23 

06:23 no oh Modern Art I feel is is really
06:28 

06:28 really weird like most of the time I
06:30 

06:30 feel like this is Art this like the
06:32 

06:32 Flesh of color anyone can do that right
06:35 

06:35 oops upper interpretation yeah so you
06:39 

06:39 would have to be really deep in that
06:42 

06:42 scene and know the who is who of of the
06:44 

06:44 upcoming artists and so on and uh I I
06:48 

06:48 don't have the time to mingle with with
06:50 

06:50 this scene and get to know everybody so
06:52 

06:52 um it's yeah there's a lot of Insider
06:55 

06:55 knowledge and and you know rich people
06:57 

06:57 pushing up certain artists and then it
06:59 

06:59 becomes self-fulfilling prophecy that
07:01 

07:01 that artist will become valuable within
07:03 

07:03 their lifetime right so yeah yeah it's
07:06 

07:06 it's beautiful but I I don't dare to use
07:08 

07:08 this as an investment
07:10 

07:10 vehicle what's your take on nfds oh my
07:13 

07:13 God yeah
07:15 

07:15 um well since it's on ethereum and I
07:17 

07:17 think that everything except Bitcoin is
07:19 

07:19 a scam I didn't touch it and it turned
07:21 

07:21 out I was right NF the whole NFD craze
07:24 

07:24 came we actually implemented nfts on our
07:26 

07:26 platform as well against my will and um
07:29 

07:29 no nobody ever bought any nft from our
07:31 

07:31 platform nobody cares about it anymore
07:33 

07:33 it's dead basically um I
07:37 

07:37 think the philosophy behind it is quite
07:40 

07:40 cool to have some digital thing that you
07:42 

07:42 know you can own but Bitcoin already is
07:45 

07:45 that Bitcoin is uh something digital
07:48 

07:48 digital that's also scars I mean when
07:51 

07:51 you think about that's an incredible uh
07:53 

07:53 Innovation right normally we can copy
07:55 

07:55 files on a computer nothing digital can
07:58 

07:58 ever be scar you can just copy and paste
07:59 

07:59 it but you can't copy and paste Bitcoins
08:02 

08:02 so they solve that thing that digital
08:04 

08:04 digital things cannot be scars right um
08:07 

08:07 and with nfts I think the problem is
08:08 

08:08 simply
08:10 

08:10 um when they are art they are very large
08:13 

08:13 in the file size so you can't put them
08:15 

08:15 on the blockchain because a blockchain
08:17 

08:17 only works when the block space is
08:18 

08:18 limited and there's a there's a market
08:20 

08:20 competing for the block space so what do
08:23 

08:23 they do they actually put it on some
08:24 

08:24 other uh storage maybe the
08:26 

08:26 interplanetary file system or just
08:29 

08:29 Dropbox or anything or Google Drive and
08:32 

08:32 on the blockchain they just put a
08:33 

08:33 pointer to where the actual file is so
08:37 

08:37 that means and then usually that pointer
08:39 

08:39 points to a domain of the people who all
08:41 

08:41 run the nft marketplace what if that
08:43 

08:43 domain goes down all the pointers are
08:46 

08:46 gone
08:47 

08:47 so what if Dropbox goes down or or
08:51 

08:51 Google drive or wherever they store it
08:53 

08:53 all the works are gone right so yeah I
08:56 

08:56 don't know it's the idea is cool but it
08:58 

08:58 doesn't work on on the ethereum
09:00 

09:00 blockchain and and on any blockchain it
09:02 

09:02 also wouldn't work on the Bitcoin
09:03 

09:03 blockchain because there the block space
09:05 

09:05 is even scarcer yeah
09:08 

09:08 so there was a u recently there was well
09:12 

09:12 not recently maybe sometime last year I
09:13 

09:13 can't remember there was a Exhibition at
09:15 

09:15 Art Science Museum where they did
09:17 

09:17 something about crypto and nfts and
09:20 

09:20 there were actually some really cool
09:21 

09:21 projects where I thought oh this is
09:23 

09:23 actually kind of cool in terms of art
09:25 

09:25 well like you know art is supposed to
09:27 

09:27 make you feel something and reflect on
09:28 

09:28 things like I I think think uh monkey uh
09:31 

09:31 pictures or like pixelated n that these
09:35 

09:35 kind of nfts that's not hard I that's
09:38 

09:38 somebody messing around with Photoshop
09:40 

09:40 and then claiming that it's now worth
09:42 

09:42 $10,000 which is of course nonsense
09:44 

09:44 right yeah but yeah um I haven't debled
09:47 

09:47 with it myself enough um but there are
09:51 

09:51 some ways to make really Innovative art
09:53 

09:53 with nfts but this whole thing that oh
09:56 

09:56 you own some digit digital thing and it
09:58 

09:58 it belongs to you forever that the way
10:01 

10:01 how it's set up right now is actually
10:03 

10:03 not fulfilling that promise yeah I like
10:05 

10:05 how you explain it because in this case
10:07 

10:07 even though it's so closely related to
10:09 

10:09 it's the same technology right Bitcoin
10:11 

10:11 and nfts in this case you knew that it
10:13 

10:13 was technically unsound for what it was
10:15 

10:15 proposing so this goes back to like that
10:16 

10:16 due diligence yes go back and then look
10:19 

10:19 at like the principles of that thing
10:20 

10:20 that you're investing and see if it
10:22 

10:22 actually makes sense for the long term
10:25 

10:25 and I think that was my feeling around
10:27 

10:27 uh nfts as well I was very dubious about
10:29 

10:29 it I think the only thing I was
10:30 

10:30 interested in was the aspect of uh uh
10:33 

10:33 potentially protecting artists yeah yeah
10:35 

10:35 but even that is kind of like uh
10:38 

10:38 difficult but the other like claims and
10:40 

10:40 assumptions just were very technically
10:42 

10:42 unfounded um and I was just like I don't
10:44 

10:44 I don't trust this enough so naturally
10:47 

10:47 that just kind of died off but yeah I
10:49 

10:49 think all in all this summarize um your
10:52 

10:52 perspective uh over investment or what
10:54 

10:54 finances as an engineer who isn't like a
10:57 

10:57 big Silicon Valley mang engineer pulling
10:60 

10:60 in hordes of money and even if you're
11:02 

11:02 like that kind of engineer you still
11:03 

11:03 need to save and invest as well and uh
11:05 

11:05 otherwise you'll just be spending it
11:07 

11:07 every time you're paycheck comes maybe
11:08 

11:08 one last thing that we should mention
11:10 

11:10 I'm actually very thankful that I am in
11:13 

11:13 Singapore my journey wouldn't have
11:15 

11:15 worked like this in any other country
11:17 

11:17 because uh there's capital gains tax in
11:20 

11:20 Singapore there's no capital gains tax
11:22 

11:22 right so um in the US if you want to
11:25 

11:25 sell your Bitcoin in the end and have a
11:27 

11:27 nice life then you have to pay a lot of
11:29 

11:29 Texas right uh in Germany actually it's
11:31 

11:31 okay if you hold for one year then it's
11:33 

11:33 also taxfree um but in Singapore you can
11:36 

11:36 actually trade and that will be no
11:38 

11:38 capital gains taxes so um and then the
11:40 

11:40 overall taxes in Singapore I don't know
11:42 

11:42 if singaporeans think that way but as a
11:43 

11:43 German this thing is uh this country is
11:46 

11:46 a tax Haven like crazy right so um I
11:48 

11:48 feel like the money that I earn stays
11:51 

11:51 with me and it's not all uh given out
11:54 

11:54 for taxes and I have nothing left at the
11:55 

11:55 end of the month so then I can make my
11:57 

11:57 own decisions which is actually very
11:59 

11:59 very but I think I hope that um our
12:02 

12:02 politicians don't mess it up over time I
12:04 

12:04 have I feel like there's a a little bit
12:06 

12:06 of uh socialist Tendencies recently like
12:08 

12:08 the government is giving out free money
12:10 

12:10 left and right everywhere to dampen the
12:13 

12:13 effects of inflation I guess right after
12:15 

12:15 covid um I actually think that they've
12:18 

12:18 put fuel into the fire by doing this if
12:20 

12:20 you give out free money prices will go
12:23 

12:23 up that's how it works so they actually
12:25 

12:25 create more inflation trying to dampen
12:27 

12:27 the effects of inflation it's kind of
12:29 

12:29 insane I think they're really trying to
12:31 

12:31 be measured About It by giving out
12:32 

12:32 vouchers as specific to supermarkets and
12:35 

12:35 local yeah the supermarket just go up
12:38 

12:38 that's what's happening that's true yeah
12:41 

12:41 but you know all in all still like
12:43 

12:43 compare it and relative to other
12:45 

12:45 countries what you're saying is that
12:46 

12:46 Singapore you know with his tier Tech
12:48 

12:48 system is like uh very beneficial um for
12:51 

12:51 individuals to feel like they have
12:52 

12:52 autonomy over the money so it's also you
12:55 

12:55 know I mean it's it's also understanding
12:58 

12:58 the conditions of the uh uh uh places
13:01 

13:01 that you live in uh to be able to think
13:04 

13:04 about how you want to Sate finances
13:05 

13:05 because obviously if you were in the US
13:07 

13:07 then your perspective of money might be
13:09 

13:09 different because now you have to factor
13:11 

13:11 in like taxes and uh quite like a large
13:14 

13:14 scale so that might you know affect your
13:17 

13:17 retirement plans that might affect this
13:18 

13:18 so I guess what this boil is down to is
13:21 

13:21 that this last principle is also
13:22 

13:22 understand the constraints or like the
13:24 

13:24 environment that you're working in when
13:26 

13:26 it comes to your finances you know taxes
13:28 

13:28 work differently in country so I think a
13:30 

13:30 lot of people don't do this by due
13:32 

13:32 diligence when it comes to like
13:33 

13:33 understanding how your finances work in
13:35 

13:35 the place that you are operating of and
13:38 

13:38 especially with the age of like digital
13:39 

13:39 Nomads remote workers you know people
13:42 

13:42 have flexibility to locate themselves in
13:44 

13:44 uh different countries depending on the
13:46 

13:46 company that you work for yeah but I
13:48 

13:48 mean most countries these days tax you
13:49 

13:49 globally right so especially Americans
13:52 

13:52 no matter where they work they will be
13:53 

13:53 taxed in the US so they are screwed
13:55 

13:55 that's true but you could also do for
13:57 

13:57 Germany if I spend half a year in the
13:59 

13:59 other count then I will be text to the
13:60 

13:60 other country so yeah yeah I think
14:03 

14:03 companies are cognizant of that as well
14:05 

14:05 yeah but there are other things you can
14:07 

14:07 do that even if you know you're located
14:09 

14:09 and you're paid like us salary and then
14:11 

14:11 tax us but maybe you could own foreign
14:13 

14:13 property somewhere else and the tax is a
14:15 

14:15 different so kind of like also doing
14:17 

14:17 that uh due diligence study and look at
14:20 

14:20 your different options um I guess the
14:22 

14:22 digital NOA thing is less about taxes
14:25 

14:25 but more about earning uh Western salary
14:29 

14:29 but living in a country where the living
14:31 

14:31 cost is very low so you have more left
14:34 

14:34 over which you can then invest yeah yeah
14:36 

14:36 I think that's a really important aspect
14:38 

14:38 to think about as well the cost of
14:40 

14:40 living that goes into like knowing your
14:42 

14:42 budget right yeah that that same amount
14:44 

14:44 of money that could uh fetch you like
14:46 

14:46 this amount of meals in one country you
14:47 

14:47 can fetch you that amount of meals in
14:48 

14:48 another country so there's a lot of
14:50 

14:50 things you can do around finances um
14:53 

14:53 evaluate your constraints know your the
14:55 

14:55 opportunities and just be smart about
14:57 

14:57 your money so we hope like this segment
