00:00 I can honestly say that my job is very
00:03 

00:03 difficult for AI to do like my
00:05 

00:05 day-to-day job. How do you function in
00:06 

00:06 that ecosystem? Take our team maybe
00:09 

00:09 through a product manager or just
00:12 

00:12 directly with us. They might lie us with
00:13 

00:13 us to come up with a solution. How can
00:16 

00:16 we design the solution better? [music]
00:24 

00:24 Hello everybody. Welcome to Rectag. This
00:26 

00:26 is the place where real life people talk
00:27 

00:27 about real life in tech. Today we're
00:29 

00:29 going to be doing uh another episode
00:31 

00:31 from our series AI isn't taking our job.
00:33 

00:33 Insert role here. And today's role is
00:35 

00:35 going to be solutions engineer. Before
00:37 

00:37 that, let's introduce ourselves. My name
00:39 

00:39 is Natasha. I'm your co-host. I'm also a
00:41 

00:41 software engineer. I'm Salon, software
00:43 

00:43 developer. And I'm Victoria, solutions
00:45 

00:45 engineer. And Victoria is also our guest
00:48 

00:48 for today. Um so yeah, I guess it's kind
00:51 

00:51 of awkward introducing her because we
00:53 

00:53 like we know her so well, but uh well,
00:55 

00:55 Victoria is a solutions engineer. uh and
00:58 

00:58 she's uh done that for various across
01:00 

01:00 industries and across different types of
01:02 

01:02 companies as well from large companies
01:04 

01:04 and uh now currently in a form of
01:06 

01:06 startup as well. Um so we will have here
01:09 

01:09 her here today to tell us more about
01:11 

01:11 what solutions engineering is. So a lot
01:13 

01:13 of people have asked me this question
01:15 

01:15 because solutions engineer is not a
01:17 

01:17 title you often come across especially
01:19 

01:19 if you're like a super technical person.
01:21 

01:21 Brief description of solutions engineers
01:23 

01:23 we're a client-f facing software
01:25 

01:25 engineer. That's the best way I can say
01:27 

01:27 it like in a very TLDDR kind of way. In
01:29 

01:29 a more deeper kind of way, solutions
01:31 

01:31 engineers are pretty much engineers who
01:33 

01:33 wear different hats. So, communicating
01:36 

01:36 and bridging that communication among
01:38 

01:38 various teams like product, external
01:40 

01:40 facing stakeholders, internal
01:42 

01:42 stakeholders as well. So, we essentially
01:45 

01:45 help with building the tools,
01:47 

01:47 frameworks, anything that is needed in
01:50 

01:50 order to fulfill like a solving a
01:52 

01:52 problem. So we are both builders,
01:55 

01:55 communicators as well as project
01:57 

01:57 managers. So you mentioned that you work
01:59 

01:59 kind of like across a lot of teams. So
02:01 

02:01 we have a stack of like uh role cards
02:04 

02:04 here. Can take a look at the roles here
02:06 

02:06 and just kind of briefly tell us how do
02:08 

02:08 you work with these roles or if there
02:09 

02:09 are roles not in this stack as well like
02:12 

02:12 how how do you function in that
02:13 

02:13 ecosystem?
02:14 

02:14 >> Okay. Um so let's say this is me
02:17 

02:17 solutions engineer and then there's the
02:19 

02:19 product team. So there's the software
02:21 

02:21 engineer, a typical like someone in the
02:23 

02:23 product team. So let's say there is the
02:26 

02:26 dashboard analytics tool, you know,
02:28 

02:28 there is a lot of um user feedback
02:31 

02:31 around it. Maybe things have to be
02:33 

02:33 improved, things are like not working as
02:36 

02:36 uh intended. They might uh instead
02:39 

02:39 because they have other projects that
02:40 

02:40 they have to focus on, right? They
02:42 

02:42 might, you know, contact our team maybe
02:45 

02:45 through a product manager or just
02:47 

02:47 directly with us. they might li us with
02:49 

02:49 us to come up with a solution. How can
02:52 

02:52 we design the solution better in order
02:54 

02:54 to either automate things, workflows,
02:57 

02:57 dev ops, things that they need in order
02:59 

02:59 to get their daily work working. So this
03:02 

03:02 would be internal facing cuz you know
03:04 

03:04 this software engineer and then the
03:06 

03:06 external facing one is the one that I
03:08 

03:08 often do the most. Pretend this is
03:10 

03:10 client is and then pretend this is
03:12 

03:12 sales. Pretend this is I will add those
03:14 

03:14 rows. Yeah. So when with the client this
03:16 

03:16 is what we do. um we will have products
03:19 

03:19 that we sell to the clients for
03:21 

03:21 integration purposes. So I'm in
03:23 

03:23 payments. So usually our clients are you
03:26 

03:26 know big to small businesses who wants
03:28 

03:28 to integrate a payment solution and
03:30 

03:30 there's many different types of payment
03:32 

03:32 solution. Probably on the consumer side
03:34 

03:34 you only know like things like payments
03:35 

03:35 app like that but actually there's a lot
03:38 

03:38 of like most of you probably know cuz
03:40 

03:40 you're in payments as well. There's a
03:41 

03:41 lot other products that we talk about.
03:42 

03:42 So this is when we do requirements
03:44 

03:44 gathering. So I will go talk to the
03:46 

03:46 client and this is all in a technical
03:48 

03:48 sense because I'm the solutions
03:49 

03:49 engineer. The sales will focus on the
03:51 

03:51 pricing and negotiating the price. I
03:53 

03:53 will focus on technical capabilities. So
03:56 

03:56 how many people are in their team? What
03:57 

03:57 is their current architecture? What
03:59 

03:59 current APIs they're using? uh all the
04:01 

04:01 databases and all things that would
04:04 

04:04 require them from me to also communicate
04:07 

04:07 what our product does because I need to
04:10 

04:10 tell them whether or not our product is
04:12 

04:12 a fit for their company and there's been
04:15 

04:15 a lot of times where like the company
04:17 

04:17 say I want a custom solution obviously
04:20 

04:20 right they don't want like oh out of the
04:22 

04:22 box some do because it's really simple
04:24 

04:24 and fast but some is like give me a
04:26 

04:26 custom solution because our tax stack
04:28 

04:28 doesn't fit yours and there's a lot of
04:30 

04:30 other complications, compliance, risk
04:33 

04:33 for things that they want to include
04:35 

04:35 that is not a 100% match with our
04:38 

04:38 product. So that's when we have to build
04:40 

04:40 custom solutions, we will have meetings
04:42 

04:42 with the external client and our team
04:44 

04:44 and then we'll also um build that
04:47 

04:47 solution with them. So first we would
04:49 

04:49 probably after the requirements of the
04:51 

04:51 gathering it will be pre-integration. So
04:53 

04:53 it'll be building demos uh building um
04:56 

04:56 certain mocks mockups for them to so
04:58 

04:58 that they understand these are the
05:01 

05:01 capabilities that we are proposing. We
05:03 

05:03 do something called a sddd solution
05:06 

05:06 design document. So the solution design
05:08 

05:08 document is essentially these are some
05:10 

05:10 of the options that we have. We also do
05:11 

05:11 costbenefit analysis to make sure that
05:13 

05:13 you know it's within their budget. It's
05:15 

05:15 within their timeline and their
05:16 

05:16 requirements. That's part of requirement
05:18 

05:18 gathering. So everything will be in the
05:19 

05:19 SDDD. we'll send it back to the client
05:21 

05:21 and they will usually have meetings
05:23 

05:23 again and again and again. So again this
05:26 

05:26 is a lot of uh communication but from a
05:28 

05:28 technical perspective architecture
05:30 

05:30 system design. Oh, that's interesting
05:32 

05:32 actually cuz as a software developer, I
05:34 

05:34 feel like a lot of things that you said
05:36 

05:36 are also things that I would do as a
05:38 

05:38 software developer. Solutions engineer
05:40 

05:40 has to be a lot more skilled in
05:42 

05:42 communication cuz you have to now
05:44 

05:44 simplify all these technical jargon that
05:47 

05:47 that's in your company that you are u
05:50 

05:50 representing in a way that non- tech
05:52 

05:52 clients will understand and also still
05:55 

05:55 able to work with their system. So you
05:57 

05:57 have to talk to not only the non- tech
05:59 

05:59 people at this client also there are
06:01 

06:01 developers at this client to make sure
06:03 

06:03 okay this works and for you this this is
06:05 

06:05 how it is in lay momentum which not all
06:09 

06:09 software developers are skilled enough
06:11 

06:11 to do exactly and I think for me
06:14 

06:14 personally it was an advantage for me
06:16 

06:16 because I came from a nontech background
06:18 

06:18 so I know exactly what they're confused
06:20 

06:20 about because I was confused I was back
06:22 

06:22 then also nontech so I don't understand
06:25 

06:25 so being able to teach someone from zero
06:28 

06:28 like I need to teach them what API means
06:30 

06:30 sometimes what the docs mean some
06:33 

06:33 sometimes you know and all these little
06:35 

06:35 things that usually would cause you know
06:38 

06:38 see if if I'm not the bridge right
06:40 

06:40 >> it will cause rest to a software
06:42 

06:42 engineer
06:42 

06:42 >> oh for sure software so once I lias with
06:46 

06:46 the client and we already like decided
06:48 

06:48 on pre-integration things it will be
06:51 

06:51 integration time so that is when every
06:53 

06:53 day it's like project management like I
06:55 

06:55 said every day with follow up with the
06:57 

06:57 client making sure that their
06:58 

06:58 integration is running smoothly and this
07:01 

07:01 is when sometimes our external clients
07:03 

07:03 would feed back to us right there's a
07:05 

07:05 problem with the SDK there's a problem
07:07 

07:07 with the API I don't like the way this
07:09 

07:09 is done or like I need a more custom
07:12 

07:12 solution for this to implement this
07:13 

07:13 software we can li us with the product
07:15 

07:15 team as well this is when we also lift
07:18 

07:18 with either through a product manager or
07:19 

07:19 without
07:20 

07:20 >> I was just going to ask that cuz your
07:22 

07:22 role is a little bit like a product
07:23 

07:23 manager like a technical
07:25 

07:25 >> if I'm pretty okay like cuz see my my
07:28 

07:28 company right now is kind of small we
07:30 

07:30 don't really have a dedicated product
07:32 

07:32 manager so I'm kind of a pseudo product
07:34 

07:34 manager then I would be giving the user
07:36 

07:36 feedback to the software engineer and
07:38 

07:38 say hey there's like an issue here or
07:41 

07:41 there's a bug or they want it as graphql
07:45 

07:45 engineers that no but I'm nicer to tech
07:48 

07:48 people and also I'll update the sales
07:49 

07:49 like hey how's the project I want my
07:51 

07:51 money and I'm like okay yes it's
07:54 

07:54 >> yeah I'm going to hit my KPI Nice. Yeah.
07:56 

07:56 And I'm saying it's going well. Don't
07:57 

07:57 worry. So, so I will also lift with
07:60 

07:60 sales for that. And then there's also
08:01 

08:01 risk and compliance. If you're in
08:03 

08:03 payments, right? Pretend this is risk
08:04 

08:04 and compliance. So, yeah. Again, it's
08:06 

08:06 like I talk to everyone. Basically, I
08:08 

08:08 talk to everyone every day. So, that is
08:10 

08:10 a solutions engineer communication has
08:14 

08:14 to be really good and you be able to
08:15 

08:15 talk to sizing, right? So many different
08:17 

08:17 roles.
08:17 

08:17 >> Yeah. Exactly. I know, right? So in a
08:19 

08:19 way it's like switching gears all the
08:21 

08:21 time from non- tech to tech to risk
08:24 

08:24 compliance to all across the board
08:26 

08:26 essentially. So it's a lot of switching
08:28 

08:28 gears. I would say when I first get into
08:30 

08:30 this it was quite overwhelming to switch
08:32 

08:32 so many gears, right? But over time I
08:35 

08:35 got used to it and I like how diverse
08:36 

08:36 the role is. So every day is not that
08:38 

08:38 boring.
08:39 

08:39 >> Well, you said that you're good at
08:40 

08:40 communication and you work with everyone
08:42 

08:42 and you also do live demo. So today we
08:44 

08:44 will put the live demo skills to test
08:46 

08:46 test. Okay. a new deck of cards. So the
08:49 

08:49 first deck of cards is our idea cards.
08:52 

08:52 This is a set of app ideas. So treat
08:54 

08:54 them as like client requests, I guess,
08:56 

08:56 like, hey, come build this new feature,
08:58 

08:58 this new app for me. So choose one that
09:00 

09:00 you know something that you're confident
09:02 

09:02 in, something that sounds familiar or
09:04 

09:04 something that you find interesting.
09:06 

09:06 >> Okay. So I remember in the last episode,
09:08 

09:08 Slowly did payments already. That's why
09:11 

09:11 I decided, you know what? Let's try a
09:13 

09:13 new challenge. I'm going to go with Brew
09:15 

09:15 Buddy. T's favorite app.
09:17 

09:17 >> No, no, he's just always on it.
09:20 

09:20 >> It's not. It's not. Don't. What is Brew
09:22 

09:22 Buddy?
09:22 

09:22 >> Yes. Okay. Yes. Brew Buddy is
09:24 

09:24 essentially matching coffee lovers based
09:27 

09:27 on taste and vibe. Like speed dating for
09:29 

09:29 your morning brew.
09:32 

09:32 Okay. Perfect. So, we've got our app.
09:34 

09:34 So, now you have to approach this. Okay.
09:37 

09:37 Try not to approach this like a solution
09:39 

09:39 a software engineer but really try to
09:41 

09:41 see how you can elucidate your role as a
09:44 

09:44 solutions engineer um through selecting
09:47 

09:47 and designing this uh system design. So
09:50 

09:50 this set of cards contains like elements
09:53 

09:53 in in a system. So uh yeah take it away.
09:56 

09:56 >> Sure. So let's say I'm a company that
09:59 

09:59 wants to integrate products of uh Brew
10:01 

10:01 Buddy with within other like websites or
10:04 

10:04 with other small businesses. Let's say
10:07 

10:07 this business just for the sake of team
10:08 

10:08 building, team bonding, they want a
10:10 

10:10 system like this within their company,
10:12 

10:12 right? So first step is requirements
10:15 

10:15 gathering, right? So I ask like okay,
10:17 

10:17 what's the current system that you have
10:19 

10:19 in place? Is it an app? Is it um
10:22 

10:22 website? Is it a internal tool
10:24 

10:24 dashboard? Like what kind of how do you
10:27 

10:27 want to integrate
10:29 

10:29 into your company's internal team
10:31 

10:31 bonding system? everything they have
10:33 

10:33 like architecture wise so API gateway uh
10:36 

10:36 database you know
10:38 

10:38 >> so it's like as if they had this deck of
10:40 

10:40 cards and they're telling you I have
10:41 

10:41 this I have this I have this now
10:43 

10:43 >> yeah and then you know u even servers
10:46 

10:46 sometimes cuz we want to know like you
10:48 

10:48 know what they are using you know cloud
10:50 

10:50 hosting essentially everything like
10:52 

10:52 dashboard you know let's say employee
10:56 

10:56 profiles are also important to secure so
10:58 

10:58 >> oh yeah I want other people to know yeah
11:01 

11:01 >> important Okay. [laughter] But anyway,
11:05 

11:05 uh so yeah, I'll just go with this for
11:07 

11:07 now. Um just to keep it minimal because
11:09 

11:09 usually the client is also non tech. We
11:12 

11:12 don't want to overwhelm them. So this is
11:14 

11:14 some of the things that I will look for
11:16 

11:16 essentially like their overarch
11:17 

11:17 architecture just so that I can get an
11:19 

11:19 idea how we can integrate brewy into
11:22 

11:22 their system. So after the requirements
11:24 

11:24 gathering it will be pre-integration. So
11:26 

11:26 again we'll come up with a solution
11:28 

11:28 design document. So how we are answering
11:31 

11:31 questions like how we want to integrate
11:33 

11:33 basically like in a macro point of view
11:35 

11:35 and then we'll also dive deep into like
11:37 

11:37 what is the frequency of you're going to
11:39 

11:39 use this system like let's say team
11:40 

11:40 bonding is like across every team versus
11:43 

11:43 like oh we only want to try this with
11:45 

11:45 one team first uh a challenge that I
11:47 

11:47 remember when I was first starting as a
11:49 

11:49 social engineer like I don't know what
11:51 

11:51 question to ask cuz sometimes you don't
11:53 

11:53 know what you don't know and then you're
11:55 

11:55 like oh I didn't think of that I didn't
11:57 

11:57 think I should ask like do you want it
11:59 

11:59 across all teams or you just want to
12:01 

12:01 beta test one team. I I didn't think
12:02 

12:02 about it and then sometimes the merchant
12:04 

12:04 I call them merchant can decline. So so
12:06 

12:06 sometimes the merchant themselves don't
12:08 

12:08 also know so only up till like during
12:10 

12:10 the integration phase late into the
12:13 

12:13 integration phase they say wait is this
12:15 

12:15 AI going to be integrated for
12:17 

12:17 everything? Oh, that becomes a change
12:19 

12:19 request then you're like
12:20 

12:20 >> and then that would happen right so this
12:23 

12:23 is something not covered in system
12:25 

12:25 design but it's something that that's
12:27 

12:27 why communication is very important as a
12:29 

12:29 solicious engineer you have to basically
12:32 

12:32 flip every stone you know leave no stone
12:34 

12:34 unturned ask many questions as possible
12:37 

12:37 sometimes you ask a very stupid
12:39 

12:39 questions like oh okay um there's no
12:42 

12:42 such thing as stupid question
12:44 

12:44 >> uh I was waiting for a stupid for
12:45 

12:45 example stupid question do we need to
12:47 

12:47 include names for this uh internal Brew
12:50 

12:50 Buddy app because we know each other.
12:52 

12:52 What?
12:53 

12:53 >> Ah, okay. Yeah. Do you want to identify
12:55 

12:55 based on employee ID or employee name?
12:57 

12:57 >> She just translated that stupid question
12:59 

12:59 to technical.
12:60 

12:60 >> Yeah. So, so sometimes Okay. So,
13:02 

13:02 sometimes the other way around.
13:03 

13:03 Sometimes it's not me that ask stupid
13:05 

13:05 questions. Merchant might ask stupid
13:06 

13:06 question and then I quickly identify,
13:09 

13:09 oh, this is what they mean cuz sometimes
13:11 

13:11 they don't they're not sure what does it
13:13 

13:13 mean in terms of technical perspective.
13:16 

13:16 Like just now when you ask right you
13:18 

13:18 pretending to be a merchant I'll answer
13:19 

13:19 it in a technical point of view so I
13:22 

13:22 translate also come up with like
13:24 

13:24 analogies sometimes you know so um for
13:28 

13:28 example one client right uh in terms of
13:30 

13:30 data they they want the digital
13:32 

13:32 transformation product that would easily
13:35 

13:35 clean all their data and then they asked
13:37 

13:37 me like okay I actually can you explain
13:39 

13:39 to me because I don't know what's the
13:41 

13:41 importance of data cleaning cuz they're
13:43 

13:43 nam right and they they just got into
13:45 

13:45 this call with no prior context. So I
13:48 

13:48 told them like imagine you have a house
13:50 

13:50 right don't your house need daily
13:52 

13:52 cleaning right your house need daily
13:55 

13:55 cleaning but if it's too much for you we
13:58 

13:58 can also do weekly cleaning right but
14:01 

14:01 more or less your house definitely needs
14:03 

14:03 cleaning you cannot just wait until
14:04 

14:04 things get messy then you clean your
14:05 

14:05 house so that is an analogy I use so uh
14:09 

14:09 essentially solutions engineer do this I
14:10 

14:10 really always come up with analogies
14:13 

14:13 interesting interesting I actually want
14:15 

14:15 to understand how do you use AI in all
14:18 

14:18 of this uh like all these things that
14:21 

14:21 you have just explained in communication
14:23 

14:23 talking to people using these tools and
14:26 

14:26 we do have a deck of cards for for you
14:29 

14:29 to look at where and how do you use AI.
14:32 

14:32 Ooh, yeah. These are tool cards. So,
14:34 

14:34 they also include nonI tools, but like
14:37 

14:37 yeah, you can whatever.
14:37 

14:37 >> Okay. So, um I think the first one that
14:40 

14:40 pops out to me is Tableau.
14:42 

14:42 >> Pablau.
14:43 

14:43 >> Tableau. Pronounced the same way
14:44 

14:44 actually, but yeah, Tableau is because
14:47 

14:47 see after we integrate, right, there's
14:49 

14:49 the go live period and then there's the
14:52 

14:52 monitoring phase. So, that's when we
14:54 

14:54 also have to be troubleshooters
14:56 

14:56 >> that that's when a lot of monitoring
14:58 

14:58 happens and we need to look at data,
14:59 

14:59 right? So, I use this tool a lot. So
15:02 

15:02 this is where I also create dashboards
15:04 

15:04 and analytics right so I can see oh
15:05 

15:05 after go live does the conversion rate
15:08 

15:08 increase
15:09 

15:09 >> I need to prove to them that hey our
15:11 

15:11 product is helping you this is evidence
15:13 

15:13 you know so this is what I use and they
15:16 

15:16 have AI features in it
15:18 

15:18 >> which is like I give them a prompt right
15:20 

15:20 I say like uh given this huge chunk of
15:23 

15:23 data right summarize like key insights
15:26 

15:26 you know and make me a simple graph
15:29 

15:29 right either or or query give me uh SQL
15:32 

15:32 query for this you know that I can use
15:34 

15:34 to easily make graphic dashboards so
15:37 

15:37 this is something I use and this is
15:38 

15:38 something that AI has been helpful in
15:40 

15:40 automating especially when you have a
15:42 

15:42 portfolio of customers right
15:44 

15:44 >> you don't want to create custom
15:45 

15:45 dashboard for each and every takes so
15:47 

15:47 much time
15:48 

15:48 >> so AI oh okay I would say co-pilot is
15:52 

15:52 common so for my company we have
15:54 

15:54 co-pilot premium uh we use this for
15:57 

15:57 again coding PR reviews so one of my Job
16:01 

16:01 scope is okay again we review features
16:04 

16:04 right cuz we give them user feedback and
16:06 

16:06 then sometimes they ask us okay can you
16:08 

16:08 review if this feature is as you
16:09 

16:09 intended as you requested so then I'll
16:11 

16:11 review PRs right very good you can
16:14 

16:14 review PRs oh but that's interesting
16:16 

16:16 like as a solutions engineer why would
16:19 

16:19 you review PRs is that other software
16:21 

16:21 developers job
16:23 

16:23 >> so in a way because my team is a startup
16:26 

16:26 so I wear different hat in previous uh
16:29 

16:29 company I'm only solutions engineer then
16:32 

16:32 I don't review PR
16:33 

16:33 >> but cuz I'm a startup so I have I had
16:36 

16:36 >> but I could imagine uh why this would be
16:37 

16:37 useful because the solutions engineer
16:39 

16:39 has the closest access to the direct uh
16:42 

16:42 uh uh expected behavior like she
16:44 

16:44 actually knows what the client wants and
16:46 

16:46 she was the one who wrote the STD
16:47 

16:47 anyways so in this case her reviewing
16:50 

16:50 the PR her testing the feature out and
16:51 

16:51 then seeing does the actual behavior
16:54 

16:54 match the expected behavior actually
16:55 

16:55 makes sense I'm a huge advocate of like
16:57 

16:57 even non-functional people reviewing PRs
16:59 

16:59 and I actually meet a a functional PM
17:03 

17:03 try his hand out at running uh the local
17:07 

17:07 dev environment and then comment on the
17:09 

17:09 PR itself and I found that very useful I
17:12 

17:12 can see like why it's even more relevant
17:14 

17:14 for solutions engineer
17:15 

17:15 >> I I would think like maybe just staging
17:17 

17:17 environment or the UAT environment
17:19 

17:19 testing would be something you would cuz
17:22 

17:22 you're just looking at whether the
17:24 

17:24 feature is as I expected and you should
17:26 

17:26 just looking at the end of it not into
17:28 

17:28 the details of
17:30 

17:30 That makes sense too. I I get that.
17:32 

17:32 Yeah. But um but you can review the code
17:35 

17:35 then it might not because
17:36 

17:36 >> you have the knowledge.
17:38 

17:38 >> It should not be my main daytoday kind
17:40 

17:40 of job. It's more like my side mission.
17:42 

17:42 >> Yeah.
17:42 

17:42 >> I see. And anyway like she then she can
17:44 

17:44 catch like the changes early not when it
17:47 

17:47 really went to staging a UAT. Then she's
17:49 

17:49 like okay yeah not well you probably
17:51 

17:51 aren't like focusing on the code reviews
17:53 

17:53 that much. That's why you're using
17:54 

17:54 co-pilot right? So co-pilot, you do the
17:57 

17:57 code review, but maybe I'll just come in
17:59 

17:59 more as like I'm seeing if it matches
18:02 

18:02 the behavior I asked.
18:03 

18:03 >> Yeah. So it offloads the code review for
18:06 

18:06 you in definitely it automates a lot of
18:08 

18:08 the mundane task for me and it just
18:11 

18:11 catches things that you know if I'm in a
18:13 

18:13 rush I might not catch. So
18:15 

18:15 >> it is very good. It's very good in the
18:19 

18:19 Yeah, I think that's the main tool for
18:20 

18:20 now.
18:21 

18:21 >> That's definitely the main two.
18:24 

18:24 Asia using reason for your demos like
18:25 

18:25 since you are going to spin them and
18:27 

18:27 then yeah so some of my merchants are
18:29 

18:29 not English speakaking and I have oh
18:32 

18:32 yeah oh that makes sense oh makes sense
18:34 

18:34 and I have problem with non-English
18:37 

18:37 because my English is my best language
18:39 

18:39 so sometimes demos speak a thousand
18:42 

18:42 words so I just make demos and if I want
18:46 

18:46 to spin out a demo quickly I usually
18:48 

18:48 have a go-to playground that I can just
18:50 

18:50 you know showcase all the features in
18:52 

18:52 one playground
18:52 

18:52 But sometimes the merchant who is
18:54 

18:54 nontechnical is like I don't understand
18:57 

18:57 this is not what what our website looks
18:58 

18:58 like. So I'm like okay I have to make
19:02 

19:02 them be able to visualize what the
19:04 

19:04 feature looks like on their website. So
19:06 

19:06 I just take their website and I say and
19:08 

19:08 I v code I say duplicate me the website
19:12 

19:12 and add the feature in.
19:14 

19:14 >> Yeah.
19:14 

19:14 >> Yeah. So they see an interactive demo.
19:17 

19:17 So um previously it was just like static
19:20 

19:20 mockup. So people would use like you
19:22 

19:22 know design tools Canva or Photoshop to
19:24 

19:24 like mix static mockups but then they'll
19:27 

19:27 be asking things like what is the user
19:29 

19:29 flow like I want to see end to end like
19:31 

19:31 what buttons to click and all that and
19:33 

19:33 pictures can only show so much but if I
19:36 

19:36 use um demo then I can really show the
19:39 

19:39 interactivity of it all. So that's why I
19:41 

19:41 would say VIP code is a really good use
19:44 

19:44 of AI to quickly spin up these demos,
19:47 

19:47 right? And it's not like I have to make
19:48 

19:48 a full stack website of their like a
19:50 

19:50 duplicate of their website. I don't have
19:51 

19:51 to make a full
19:52 

19:52 >> dummy all dummy data to next screen.
19:55 

19:55 >> Yeah. Think of it like in vision, you
19:57 

19:57 know, it's like those mockup.
19:58 

19:58 >> Can I ask like why don't you just use
20:00 

20:00 like a prototyping tool like
20:03 

20:03 >> because like I am a cuz I am a bike
20:06 

20:06 coder.
20:07 

20:07 >> Oh, it's easier for you, right? This one
20:08 

20:08 has a learning curve for you since
20:10 

20:10 you're not Okay. Okay.
20:11 

20:11 >> You just have to drag and drop things. I
20:13 

20:13 mean, I don't know if they already have
20:15 

20:15 involved, but drag and drop.
20:17 

20:17 >> No, that's true. That's a good question
20:18 

20:18 though. But but yeah, I I'm really used
20:20 

20:20 to um I'm a bite code. Yeah, that's
20:22 

20:22 mostly it.
20:22 

20:22 >> So So even for your use case, you are
20:24 

20:24 saying AI is like a teammate, right?
20:27 

20:27 It's it's your you're using its help to
20:30 

20:30 get things done faster, get to the end
20:32 

20:32 result faster, explain things faster.
20:35 

20:35 >> It's like a productivity tool, I would
20:37 

20:37 say. So at the end of it, do you feel
20:39 

20:39 like uh AI is going to take your job or
20:43 

20:43 is it just an aid? So I can honestly say
20:47 

20:47 that my job is very difficult for AI to
20:50 

20:50 do like my day-to-day job is involves so
20:52 

20:52 many liarsing that one AI unless they
20:56 

20:56 have like all these amounts of modeling
20:59 

20:59 knowledge agent.
21:00 

21:00 >> That's true. If everybody had digital
21:02 

21:02 twins of themselves and then you just
21:03 

21:03 like connect the agents to it
21:06 

21:06 >> and and the and but at the end of the
21:08 

21:08 day merchants want to talk to real
21:09 

21:09 people. You you cannot put an AI their
21:12 

21:12 external facing and say hey
21:15 

21:15 >> it's me Vickbot tell me your problem.
21:18 

21:18 >> The client is the agent too.
21:21 

21:21 >> I think that's like way far in the
21:23 

21:23 future. Maybe if everybody had an agent.
21:25 

21:25 >> Yeah. But I think we are currently in
21:27 

21:27 the era where people trust people more
21:30 

21:30 and sometimes you know just having my
21:32 

21:32 reaction like oh you have a long week
21:35 

21:35 with your kid or basically sometimes
21:38 

21:38 they like to start out with like
21:39 

21:39 building rapper.
21:41 

21:41 >> You cannot build rapper with a bot,
21:44 

21:44 right? I they will not ask you how's
21:46 

21:46 your weekend. They might but it's fake.
21:49 

21:49 It'll be like where they store that
21:51 

21:51 memory of the weekend too. Not in the
21:55 

21:55 brain in somewhere else, right? So yeah,
21:57 

21:57 like people will trust people
21:59 

21:59 eventually. So um I don't think like my
22:02 

22:02 day-to-day job will be replaced. I would
22:05 

22:05 say like the most that is likely is like
22:07 

22:07 all these other parts. But again, these
22:09 

22:09 are just tools I access. So I'll be the
22:11 

22:11 one that use them. So it's not my
22:14 

22:14 day-to-day job.
22:15 

22:15 >> Yeah.
22:16 

22:16 >> Yeah. No, that that really makes sense.
22:18 

22:18 Emmy all the communications unless we
22:20 

22:20 were in this future world where
22:22 

22:22 everybody had a digital twin where
22:24 

22:24 everybody was represented by an agent
22:26 

22:26 and we can do like a multi- aent u it
22:29 

22:29 it's not going to happen probably you
22:31 

22:31 have merchants who like you said speak
22:32 

22:32 different languages come from different
22:34 

22:34 backgrounds mostly non-technical so the
22:38 

22:38 solutions engineer is really here to
22:39 

22:39 bridge that gap between tech and non
22:42 

22:42 tech and uh yeah really appreciate you
22:44 

22:44 explaining all of that and also like
22:46 

22:46 laying this all out visually for us So
22:48 

22:48 we understand. I think this was also
22:49 

22:49 enlightening for Salon and myself even
22:51 

22:51 though uh we're in the tech field. Um I
22:54 

22:54 really enjoyed uh this session. So yeah,
22:57 

22:57 as always uh this was Reag. Remember to
22:60 

22:60 follow all our socials as well as give a
23:02 

23:02 comment, like and turn on notifications
23:03 

23:03 for our channel so you can get uh more
23:06 

23:06 uh notifications on our future episode.
23:10 

23:10 So yes, as always, this was Rack Track.
23:13 

23:13 Bye.
