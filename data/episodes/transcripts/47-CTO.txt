00:00 Hello everybody. Welcome to Rack Tech.
00:02 

00:02 This is the podcast where we talk about
00:04 

00:04 real life in tech with real techies in
00:06 

00:06 tech. My name is Natasha. I'm a software
00:08 

00:08 engineer. Salony software developer. I'm
00:11 

00:11 Victoria solutions engineer.
00:13 

00:13 >> And today's episode uh will be all about
00:16 

00:16 the rising trend of non-technical
00:18 

00:18 founders founding startups and finding
00:20 

00:20 it quite difficult to find CTOs for
00:23 

00:23 their startups. And uh we came across
00:25 

00:25 this topic because uh we were quite
00:27 

00:27 recently at a startup pitch night. I
00:29 

00:29 think that was last week. uh three of us
00:32 

00:32 went and there were about 10 different
00:34 

00:34 startups who pitched uh their startup to
00:37 

00:37 uh a panel of um investors and we
00:40 

00:40 noticed that first a lot of them were AI
00:42 

00:42 startups uh and two a lot of the people
00:45 

00:45 pitching were non-technical and um these
00:49 

00:49 non-technical founders um when we would
00:52 

00:52 uh talk to them some of them would reach
00:54 

00:54 out to us uh not from this specific
00:56 

00:56 pitch night but we've all been
00:57 

00:57 individually uh kind of um uh people
00:60 

01:00 have come to us asking us if we would
01:02 

01:02 like to be their CTO for their uh
01:05 

01:05 startups or if we know anyone. So in
01:08 

01:08 light of this trend uh we wanted to talk
01:10 

01:10 about this uh landscape and uh firstly
01:15 

01:15 starting off with um the trend of uh
01:18 

01:18 startups increasingly becoming AI
01:20 

01:20 centered maybe we can start with that.
01:22 

01:22 Uh I think this trend kind of comes
01:24 

01:24 about because AI has made it so
01:26 

01:26 accessible for people to um create
01:28 

01:28 startups. Uh with AI nontechnical
01:31 

01:31 founders don't need coding knowledge.
01:32 

01:32 They can use a lot of uh vibe coding
01:34 

01:34 apps. I've been hearing a lot about
01:36 

01:36 lovable base 44 um and a lot of other
01:40 

01:40 tools. Yeah. Yeah. So they're able to
01:42 

01:42 create those prototypes. I think out of
01:44 

01:44 the 10 startups there was one that
01:46 

01:46 already had a prototype going on. Um but
01:49 

01:49 with those prototypes they uh later on
01:51 

01:51 realized like wait I still need to uh
01:54 

01:54 push this out into production uh if I
01:56 

01:56 want to get investors to notice me
01:58 

01:58 >> and like scale it further.
01:59 

01:59 >> Right. Right. Exactly. They came to you
02:01 

02:01 uh looking for uh advice and contacts
02:04 

02:04 and connections. What was the background
02:06 

02:06 of their context?
02:09 

02:09 So uh this I mean there have been a few
02:13 

02:13 uh like one example would be someone
02:15 

02:15 whose CTO left somehow uh other
02:18 

02:18 opportunities or something. So then uh
02:21 

02:21 they do have a running app already live
02:23 

02:23 with a couple users or maybe 10 users
02:27 

02:27 but now to bring it further you would
02:29 

02:29 need people to fix bugs implement new
02:31 

02:31 features. So then how do I do it as a
02:33 

02:33 non- techy founder? I I need my
02:35 

02:35 technical counterpart to come in and fix
02:37 

02:37 these things cuz I ne cuz I mean as a
02:40 

02:40 non-technical founder I wouldn't know
02:43 

02:43 what are these error locks coming
02:44 

02:44 through my email what are these uh uh
02:47 

02:47 crashes or why is my site down even so
02:51 

02:51 she was uh looking for a technical
02:53 

02:53 founder basically or a technical a CTO
02:56 

02:56 basically to help her manage everything
02:58 

02:58 tech
02:59 

02:59 >> right right and uh do you know her first
03:00 

03:00 iteration was done with uh did she
03:03 

03:03 mention like a no code platform or
03:06 

03:06 >> No, but I'm sure it was a proper code
03:10 

03:10 cuz it's a mobile app.
03:11 

03:11 >> Mhm.
03:12 

03:12 >> Uh cuz I don't think mobile apps can't
03:14 

03:14 be like wipe coded that I don't know.
03:17 

03:17 >> They can be you know as long as
03:19 

03:19 >> I think they can be. I've seen I've seen
03:21 

03:21 >> Yeah. Yeah. But probably less common. I
03:23 

03:23 think a lot of vibe coded apps are web
03:25 

03:25 applications. Yeah. She definitely has
03:27 

03:27 it tough going for her it being a mobile
03:30 

03:30 ccentric uh application cuz it's harder
03:32 

03:32 to find
03:33 

03:33 >> uh developers and much less CTO's um who
03:37 

03:37 uh are uh fluent in mobile stacks and
03:41 

03:41 want to be
03:41 

03:41 >> and and this person also not only have
03:43 

03:43 to be technically uh knowledgeable but
03:46 

03:46 also have a product mindset because a
03:49 

03:49 lot of the features and bug fixes
03:53 

03:53 there's there's always this product
03:55 

03:55 thinking that's required to be able to
03:57 

03:57 fix it correctly also. So not just any
04:00 

04:00 tech person but a person who's also
04:03 

04:03 invested in that idea of the app
04:07 

04:07 >> that person should be the CTO.
04:09 

04:09 >> Yeah, exactly. I think the difficult
04:10 

04:10 part of these uh founders I mean it's
04:13 

04:13 probably easy to find a techie quote
04:15 

04:15 unquote easy like you just go to find
04:17 

04:17 somebody who has a background but what
04:19 

04:19 you need in a CTO is not only they're
04:23 

04:23 they can't just be junior level in tech
04:25 

04:25 you know that's one they they need to be
04:26 

04:26 of a mid to senior level two you're
04:28 

04:28 mentioning they need product thinking
04:30 

04:30 which honestly as software engineers
04:32 

04:32 we're not trained in that that's just
04:34 

04:34 something that you have to learn on the
04:36 

04:36 side you have to trial and error you you
04:38 

04:38 have to be lucky enough to
04:39 

04:39 done those side projects that allowed
04:41 

04:41 you to think about like uh what how do I
04:44 

04:44 find a problem? What are the minimum
04:46 

04:46 viable features? Um what is uh something
04:49 

04:49 I need to do to validate the problem.
04:51 

04:51 These are not things we do as software
04:53 

04:53 engineers. Software engineers we sit
04:54 

04:54 there and we wait for features to appear
04:56 

04:56 in a ticket and then we just wait and
04:58 

04:58 like okay this is what I have to do.
04:60 

04:60 Cool code ship not my problem anymore
05:03 

05:03 >> and then after that tell me what to do
05:04 

05:04 next and I'll do it.
05:05 

05:05 >> Exactly. Yeah. So you you need to find
05:08 

05:08 somebody with product thinking and I
05:10 

05:10 think the uh last part is somebody who
05:12 

05:12 has a certain not just product thinking
05:15 

05:15 but the ability to pitch
05:17 

05:17 >> cuz at the pitch night what we saw was
05:20 

05:20 also I mean
05:22 

05:22 >> to be able to explain tech in a to a
05:24 

05:24 lame person
05:26 

05:26 >> that's a skill.
05:27 

05:27 >> Yeah. like even just explaining why are
05:29 

05:29 we using uh
05:33 

05:33 like claude code or why are we using uh
05:36 

05:36 why aren't we using our own model and
05:38 

05:38 why are we using another existing model
05:40 

05:40 >> yeah yeah yeah
05:41 

05:41 >> why can you explain that to in in a lay
05:44 

05:44 momentum
05:44 

05:44 >> correct and and I think the increasing
05:46 

05:46 challenge is also uh investors are
05:48 

05:48 getting more tech he savvy like the
05:50 

05:50 other day we went to this pitch night
05:52 

05:52 one of the investors on the panel was
05:54 

05:54 asking very technical questions
05:56 

05:56 >> so I think this catches a lot of
05:58 

05:58 nontechnical founders offguard because
05:60 

05:60 they're like, I've never heard of these
06:01 

06:01 tech terms before. And I think it's
06:03 

06:03 because investors are getting wary. They
06:06 

06:06 know like, okay, like back then when um
06:08 

06:08 uh the tech boom was still ongoing, a
06:11 

06:11 lot of founders could uh still uh kind
06:15 

06:15 of bamboozle investors who didn't know
06:17 

06:17 better. But now investors have learned
06:19 

06:19 that um it can't just be a facade,
06:22 

06:22 right? Your team needs to be technical.
06:23 

06:23 Your product needs to be technically
06:25 

06:25 sound. So I think they're getting more
06:27 

06:27 technical people on board
06:28 

06:28 >> especially if they market their product
06:30 

06:30 as a technical solution. Correct. All
06:33 

06:33 the more the founders should expect
06:36 

06:36 technical questions right but we see
06:39 

06:39 that in reality a lot of nontechnical
06:41 

06:41 founders they see the technical part as
06:43 

06:43 a black box and they expect maybe their
06:46 

06:46 technical counterpart to step in but we
06:49 

06:49 see that a lot of technical people were
06:51 

06:51 not actually present that night. It was
06:54 

06:54 mostly the people who are, you know,
06:57 

06:57 probably in sales or marketing, the one
06:59 

06:59 that's in charge of pitching basically.
07:01 

07:01 That's correct.
07:02 

07:02 >> And then they are stumped when they are
07:05 

07:05 faced with a technical question because
07:07 

07:07 it's not something they've faced before
07:10 

07:10 and it's not something that's in their
07:11 

07:11 field of expertise. You can say that.
07:14 

07:14 >> Yeah. Exactly. And I think the funny
07:16 

07:16 part is in the past you could get away
07:18 

07:18 with like, oh, I'm not the technical
07:19 

07:19 person. But now you can't cuz you're
07:22 

07:22 going out there and you're pitching like
07:24 

07:24 this is an AI tech startup and then when
07:27 

07:27 people ask you questions you can't be
07:29 

07:29 like well I'm not the technical person
07:31 

07:31 I'm just business because your entire
07:33 

07:33 workflow has to be technical and uh for
07:36 

07:36 a lot of them their uh their products
07:38 

07:38 were also like developer products you
07:40 

07:40 know it's not just like a
07:41 

07:41 customercentricing product so I I think
07:43 

07:43 the the ask for a CTO is much higher
07:46 

07:46 than it was before I think a few years
07:48 

07:48 ago when I when I was still active in
07:50 

07:50 the startup scene, um the a lot of CTO's
07:54 

07:54 were uh college grads and that was still
07:56 

07:56 okay. They could kind of learn from on
07:58 

07:58 the on the go and stuff like that. But
08:01 

08:01 now that demand is much higher. Um and
08:04 

08:04 just now when we were researching on
08:06 

08:06 this this problem of uh uh non-technical
08:09 

08:09 founders trying to find CTOs and finding
08:11 

08:11 it difficult, they mentioned that this
08:13 

08:13 was a red ocean problem. You've
08:15 

08:15 encountered that term before. So what is
08:16 

08:16 red ocean?
08:17 

08:17 >> Yeah. So red ocean is red ocean, blue
08:19 

08:19 ocean is a business terminology.
08:22 

08:22 Basically red ocean, you can think of it
08:24 

08:24 an ocean that's like stained with so
08:25 

08:25 much blood because they're describing a
08:28 

08:28 very saturated market. You know, there's
08:30 

08:30 competitors everywhere and one by one
08:33 

08:33 every year you'll see people in the same
08:35 

08:35 market, you know, going
08:38 

08:38 bankrupt or like losing out to other
08:40 

08:40 competitors. Basically, it's a very
08:43 

08:43 shark shark kind of world. Oh, that's
08:45 

08:45 why Red Ocean like Jaws the movie
08:48 

08:48 >> basically. So that's why red ocean is
08:49 

08:49 describing a market where it's so
08:51 

08:51 saturated where the solution is always
08:53 

08:53 the same solution and how different
08:56 

08:56 businesses basically compete is maybe
08:59 

08:59 price maybe small product
09:01 

09:01 differentiation but that is it but the
09:03 

09:03 solution is technically exactly the
09:05 

09:05 same. Whereas the blue ocean which is
09:08 

09:08 the other side is an
09:10 

09:10 >> untapped untapped potential untapped
09:13 

09:13 solutions. It's where the innovation
09:15 

09:15 happens. And so at least in business we
09:18 

09:18 always talk about having a blue ocean
09:20 

09:20 strategy which means you know finding
09:22 

09:22 the areas where there's there sweet spot
09:24 

09:24 that's untapped. And of course the
09:26 

09:26 theory is once someone found the blue
09:29 

09:29 ocean it will eventually also turn into
09:31 

09:31 a red ocean because everyone will jump
09:32 

09:32 in. But that will take time. So that's
09:34 

09:34 also the first mover advantage.
09:37 

09:37 >> Yeah. So I guess in describing the the
09:40 

09:40 search for a CTO for a non-technical
09:42 

09:42 founder as red ocean, it's basically
09:44 

09:44 describing right finding a CTO is uh a
09:48 

09:48 very saturated uh market and I guess
09:51 

09:51 like taking in the perspective of people
09:54 

09:54 who are very active in the tech
09:55 

09:55 community. We know a lot of uh techies.
09:58 

09:58 Um there are also reasons as to why even
10:01 

10:01 if you're a software engineer you have
10:03 

10:03 some sort of product mindset you might
10:05 

10:05 not want to be a CTO
10:07 

10:07 >> because uh
10:08 

10:08 >> it's a huge responsibility actually you
10:10 

10:10 have to you're not just a CTO in a
10:12 

10:12 startup you're not just a CTO you will
10:14 

10:14 have to wear multiple hats
10:15 

10:15 >> there's no defined role scope for you so
10:19 

10:19 yeah in that way basically
10:21 

10:21 >> and that's why I also think like the red
10:22 

10:22 ocean talking about how CTO's are almost
10:25 

10:25 equivalent to you know that red solution
10:28 

10:28 strategy is because there's so many
10:30 

10:30 technical people out there. So
10:32 

10:32 technically so it's hard to
10:33 

10:33 differentiate who is suitable CTO
10:36 

10:36 essentially that's why it's a red ocean
10:38 

10:38 because like every company is fighting
10:40 

10:40 to like take in like the most
10:43 

10:43 technically expert people
10:45 

10:45 >> but that does not essentially mean that
10:47 

10:47 that is the
10:49 

10:49 >> the best the most suitable for their
10:51 

10:51 product their solution their use case.
10:53 

10:53 >> Yeah.
10:54 

10:54 >> Yeah. And then it it's also a big ask
10:56 

10:56 for uh people who have stable tech jobs
10:58 

10:58 to give up their careers and for what a
11:00 

11:00 CTO is asking for now that the demand
11:04 

11:04 for competence is higher. Usually these
11:06 

11:06 people are senior engineers or mid and
11:09 

11:09 your job is already quite cushy. You
11:11 

11:11 need that stability especially against
11:13 

11:13 like a a landscape of layoffs and
11:16 

11:16 retrenchments. Like why in this
11:18 

11:18 landscape would you as a senior engineer
11:21 

11:21 want to give up a what six figure uh
11:23 

11:23 monthly uh income for no guarantee no
11:27 

11:27 promises especially in such a saturated
11:29 

11:29 market where every other company is now
11:32 

11:32 tech
11:33 

11:33 >> it's it's such a big ass to ask people
11:35 

11:35 to give that up but I think like in
11:38 

11:38 light of this I've also been seeing uh
11:40 

11:40 in some places fractional CTO's being uh
11:44 

11:44 more common uh this is something new to
11:47 

11:47 me, but uh when I took a look at it,
11:48 

11:48 it's basically you pay uh where a
11:51 

11:51 company uh uh hires somebody as a CTO
11:54 

11:54 almost like a part-time basis and a uh
11:57 

11:57 fractional CTO can be advising multiple
12:01 

12:01 uh startups uh at once all the way from
12:04 

12:04 seed stage to uh BCD uh series BCD. So
12:08 

12:08 um I guess this is also uh now a common
12:12 

12:12 thing because of that saturated market.
12:14 

12:14 Actually may I ask about fractional CTOs
12:16 

12:16 because maybe I don't know it in detail
12:18 

12:18 is like do will they take responsibility
12:21 

12:21 let's say if something goes wrong in the
12:23 

12:23 technical direction honestly I think
12:25 

12:25 they're closer to like a
12:28 

12:28 >> consultant
12:29 

12:29 >> consultant or like a a you know those
12:32 

12:32 lawyers uh that are like the bench
12:36 

12:36 lawyer uh like you call them only when
12:38 

12:38 something happens but what what is
12:40 

12:40 retainer the lawyers that are on
12:42 

12:42 retainer so uh basically ally it's only
12:44 

12:44 like the lawyer doesn't sit in an office
12:47 

12:47 at the company but only when something
12:49 

12:49 happens they ask a lawyer for advice so
12:51 

12:51 a lawyer on retainer a fractional CTO is
12:54 

12:54 kind of like that you're like that
12:55 

12:55 technical advisor that I only call upon
12:57 

12:57 you when I need you so for example for
12:59 

12:59 seedstage uh startups they will call
13:02 

13:02 upon this fractional CTO to ask for
13:05 

13:05 technical strategy which developers do I
13:07 

13:07 hire like what tech stack do I need to
13:08 

13:08 set out that first groundwork but once
13:11 

13:11 that is set out I don't know what the
13:12 

13:12 period of time is if that's kind of
13:14 

13:14 arbitrary, but once that's set up, you
13:16 

13:16 already have the developers in and that
13:18 

13:18 initial uh uh stack already established,
13:21 

13:21 they're like, "Okay, bye-bye." Until
13:23 

13:23 like maybe the next round, and they're
13:26 

13:26 like, "We might need to refactor the
13:27 

13:27 codebase. We want to add another
13:29 

13:29 feature. What should we do?" So, that's
13:31 

13:31 kind of like how fractional CTO's serve.
13:34 

13:34 But I I I don't personally know a
13:36 

13:36 fractional CTO, but rather I've been
13:38 

13:38 seeing uh platforms that offer the
13:41 

13:41 service of finding a suitable fractional
13:43 

13:43 CTO. Yeah, it's probably like uh maybe
13:47 

13:47 temporary CTO as well. Like while you're
13:50 

13:50 actually finding someone who's really
13:52 

13:52 invested in the idea, get someone to
13:55 

13:55 solve the immediate problems or get get
13:57 

13:57 stuff going meanwhile.
13:59 

13:59 >> Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know if they're
14:00 

14:00 paid by equity or just like an income
14:04 

14:04 basis almost like a contract, you know.
14:07 

14:07 >> Yeah. So, at the same time, I'm thinking
14:08 

14:08 when you do that startup pitch, right,
14:10 

14:10 the team slide is so important. Who
14:13 

14:13 because the investors need to know who's
14:14 

14:14 on your team, do you put the fractional
14:16 

14:16 CTO there or do you put you do you put
14:19 

14:19 literally a fraction of his face? Like I
14:21 

14:21 don't know how it works. I
14:23 

14:23 >> I guess you you you will put the person
14:25 

14:25 there if the person's well known in the
14:26 

14:26 tech community.
14:28 

14:28 >> Right. Right. Yeah. Or or for some of
14:30 

14:30 them I see that they have an advisor
14:32 

14:32 board.
14:32 

14:32 >> So maybe they just sit on the advisor
14:35 

14:35 board
14:35 

14:35 >> or or you could just be honest with we
14:38 

14:38 are we have a fractional CTO. We don't
14:40 

14:40 have a full one.
14:41 

14:41 >> Right. Right. Then maybe you might have
14:42 

14:42 to front some questions from the
14:44 

14:44 investors. Right. Yeah. I don't know.
14:46 

14:46 But honestly with the there's been quite
14:49 

14:49 a number of people who have been coming
14:51 

14:51 to us. Uh maybe it's because of this
14:53 

14:53 podcast that we're more visible on
14:55 

14:55 social media asking us for advice,
14:57 

14:57 asking us if we want to maybe serve as
15:00 

15:00 CTO. I I also think it might also be
15:03 

15:03 because of that need to be able to make
15:06 

15:06 tech simplify tech concepts
15:09 

15:09 >> because of AI. It is so huge, such a big
15:12 

15:12 black box. Like people still don't know
15:14 

15:14 what is AI, what is generative AI, what
15:17 

15:17 are models, what is rag. We still use
15:20 

15:20 the word rag everywhere, but nobody
15:22 

15:22 knows what that is. So, it's very easy
15:24 

15:24 to confuse anyone or like just scare
15:26 

15:26 people with like let's just replace all
15:28 

15:28 your operation stuff with this solution
15:31 

15:31 and like yes, that sounds great. Let's
15:33 

15:33 take it up. And what that actually means
15:34 

15:34 is a bunch of small little agents are
15:37 

15:37 have control over all your data like
15:39 

15:39 agents.
15:40 

15:40 >> Agents AI agents
15:43 

15:43 >> I I mean it's also Asians I guess cuz a
15:46 

15:46 lot of tech is
15:48 

15:48 >> that's already happening.
15:49 

15:49 >> Yeah. But
15:50 

15:50 >> AI agents
15:51 

15:51 >> yes AI agents not AI Asians. Yeah. But
15:54 

15:54 at the same time like I I think the
15:57 

15:57 scary part is a lot of nontechnical
15:59 

15:59 founders might think they don't need a
16:01 

16:01 CTO at all. They truly believe that just
16:05 

16:05 vibe coding, no code tools is enough to
16:08 

16:08 start a tech startup. I think that's the
16:10 

16:10 part that people should be worried
16:12 

16:12 about.
16:12 

16:12 >> Oh yeah, I know what's a API. I know
16:13 

16:13 what's a database is a server. Yes,
16:15 

16:15 everything. There are tools to get these
16:18 

16:18 things. Voila. I'm a tech.
16:21 

16:21 >> They know what servers and they they
16:23 

16:23 they truly believe that the uh no code
16:25 

16:25 platform will handle all of this for
16:27 

16:27 them. you know when when asked questions
16:29 

16:29 like what's going to happen when you
16:30 

16:30 scale to uh users beyond this region
16:33 

16:33 right then for us it's intuitive like oh
16:36 

16:36 data availability and all these things
16:38 

16:38 we need to start provisioning for that
16:40 

16:40 but this is not intuitive to the layman
16:42 

16:42 because they've never encountered it
16:44 

16:44 before and I don't think that these uh
16:47 

16:47 no code platforms like help that uh with
16:50 

16:50 that kind of deployment because after
16:52 

16:52 all a lot of them are just rappers right
16:54 

16:54 just wrapping over an existing AI model
16:57 

16:57 and um they aren't uh equipped to create
17:02 

17:02 apps that scale you know and I think one
17:05 

17:05 one of the worst parts is that a lot of
17:08 

17:08 these non- techy founders who have never
17:10 

17:10 even worked in a tech company before so
17:13 

17:13 they don't know things like uh testing
17:16 

17:16 like unit testing integration testing
17:18 

17:18 the the end toend testing
17:20 

17:20 >> that you just asking it to okay now
17:23 

17:23 change this with to add this feature can
17:25 

17:25 break other parts of your
17:27 

17:27 like there has to be proper
17:28 

17:28 infrastructure in place and proper
17:30 

17:30 systems in place to ensure things that
17:32 

17:32 are already built have not changed or
17:34 

17:34 things that should change are also
17:36 

17:36 changing as a side effect of this
17:38 

17:38 >> and you know that's why there are proper
17:41 

17:41 we have been look we have been working
17:42 

17:42 in tech companies there have been
17:44 

17:44 systems agile scrum sprints
17:47 

17:47 retrospectives all of these uh small
17:49 

17:49 small rituals and steps are there for a
17:52 

17:52 reason and if you just remove this and
17:54 

17:54 just go straight forward with your
17:56 

17:56 solution like yeah just let's just tell
17:58 

17:58 it to do this and it does it
17:60 

17:60 >> you just visually you're not seeing the
18:02 

18:02 whole picture
18:04 

18:04 >> that's why it's called engineering you
18:05 

18:05 know it's more than all about the
18:08 

18:08 architecture also you know like building
18:10 

18:10 things it's like when you build a bridge
18:12 

18:12 right you don't like okay I'm going to
18:13 

18:13 change a small part of the bridge and
18:15 

18:15 you're going to ignore the rest you not
18:17 

18:17 considering the whole physics of it how
18:18 

18:18 it'll like break or anything
18:20 

18:20 >> so people see software as something like
18:23 

18:23 I think for non-coders they see it as
18:25 

18:25 like, oh, as long as the app looks like
18:28 

18:28 it works, they they don't understand the
18:30 

18:30 back end, right? Cuz they they are not,
18:32 

18:32 you know, properly educated or trained
18:33 

18:33 in this. So, they don't see it as
18:36 

18:36 engineering. They see it as coding,
18:37 

18:37 right? A lot of my um non-technical
18:40 

18:40 friends just say, "Oh, you're coder."
18:42 

18:42 Like, they don't say an engineer because
18:44 

18:44 to them maybe it's like too technical or
18:46 

18:46 something. It's just an unfamiliar term
18:48 

18:48 they use day-to-day. So coder is
18:50 

18:50 something they see and it really shows
18:52 

18:52 in how they um see VIP coding as you
18:55 

18:55 know it's like I'm building an app from
18:57 

18:57 zero to one and it works I can use it
19:02 

19:02 what about the secrets what about things
19:04 

19:04 >> right oh my gosh
19:05 

19:05 >> they they don't think about this it's
19:07 

19:07 because they don't know
19:08 

19:08 >> yeah yeah exactly I mean a good analogy
19:10 

19:10 is basically 3D printing versus uh
19:13 

19:13 manufactured products right with you
19:15 

19:15 sure you can 3D print a product for your
19:17 

19:17 specific use case, but when it comes to
19:20 

19:20 having to make sure that it fits
19:22 

19:22 everybody else's use cases, I don't
19:25 

19:25 think a 3D 3D printed product uh is is
19:29 

19:29 uh able to cater to all of that. It
19:30 

19:30 requires intensive um user discovery.
19:34 

19:34 That's one understanding that like uh
19:37 

19:37 maybe your product is going to be used
19:38 

19:38 by kids, not just adults. And kids are
19:40 

19:40 rougher with the material that you might
19:42 

19:42 have to reconsider what material you use
19:45 

19:45 to build it in. You might also have to
19:47 

19:47 consider like oh uh sure 3D printing you
19:50 

19:50 can use just I don't know non-food grade
19:53 

19:53 plastic but the use if uh the use case
19:57 

19:57 of using it in a an environment which
19:59 

19:59 requires food handling requires you to
20:02 

20:02 have food safe um plastic or something
20:04 

20:04 like those but those things will only
20:06 

20:06 come out if you know you're somebody
20:09 

20:09 trained in um that uh uh production
20:13 

20:13 process right if you're just a 3D 3D
20:16 

20:16 printer, it doesn't cut it. And I think
20:18 

20:18 the same needs to be understood of
20:20 

20:20 software. I think the problem with
20:21 

20:21 software is it's so intangible. So um
20:25 

20:25 and and it there's just so much jargon
20:28 

20:28 inside that people aren't familiar with
20:31 

20:31 it um that you can label yourself as a
20:35 

20:35 developer, but when in fact you are just
20:38 

20:38 using a noode solution. And you know,
20:41 

20:41 yeah, when when nontechnical founders,
20:43 

20:43 they're looking for developers, they
20:44 

20:44 might not know it. They might have
20:45 

20:45 accidentally contracted a no code
20:47 

20:47 developer without realizing and you know
20:52 

20:52 I think the crux of this is still uh
20:56 

20:56 literacy around the area more education
20:60 

20:60 about what actually goes on in tech
21:02 

21:02 software engineering since it's so
21:04 

21:04 pervasive in our lives but at the same
21:06 

21:06 time it is still so I don't know such an
21:09 

21:09 exclusive community. Yeah. And it's
21:11 

21:11 almost like if you're not in tech, it's
21:14 

21:14 just so intimidating.
21:16 

21:16 You'll be like, I I don't know all these
21:18 

21:18 jarens and I don't know all these terms.
21:21 

21:21 I I just want to see a working product
21:23 

21:23 that I can pitch to people and you know
21:26 

21:26 prototype. So asking them to like, oh,
21:29 

21:29 but you have to be educated on like
21:31 

21:31 certain things and at least know like
21:33 

21:33 what to secure and all that. They
21:36 

21:36 they'll find it overwhelming almost. it
21:38 

21:38 it's like they they will rather just get
21:40 

21:40 a CTO come in
21:42 

21:42 >> you know um like at least for me me
21:45 

21:45 talking to different nontechnical people
21:47 

21:47 right
21:48 

21:48 >> um there's only a few that is like oh
21:50 

21:50 teach me
21:51 

21:51 >> right right
21:52 

21:52 >> the rest would be like ah
21:54 

21:54 >> just handle it for me
21:56 

21:56 >> yeah no but I'm on the business side no
21:58 

21:58 but I have to do marketing
21:59 

21:59 >> they in a way I also understand from
22:01 

22:01 their point of view because they're
22:02 

22:02 they're confident in what they're good
22:04 

22:04 at and they think oh because you're the
22:06 

22:06 expert right I I can rely on you like
22:09 

22:09 there's no need for me to educate myself
22:11 

22:11 on this.
22:12 

22:12 >> So, so I get their point of view but at
22:14 

22:14 the same time in order for like let's
22:17 

22:17 say if they become a nontechnical
22:18 

22:18 founder right having this knowledge is
22:21 

22:21 still better than not and at least
22:23 

22:23 knowing a little bit is so that you can
22:26 

22:26 also better communicate to your CTO
22:28 

22:28 that's also good then you have shared
22:29 

22:29 vision and you can be on the same page.
22:31 

22:31 >> Exactly. I I think it's very different
22:33 

22:33 like for us like let's say here we are
22:35 

22:35 three techies trying to learn the world
22:37 

22:37 of marketing and content creation
22:39 

22:39 through doing this podcast. We've been
22:41 

22:41 doing it for two years and we're still
22:42 

22:42 learning so much. It's a it's a very
22:44 

22:44 steep learning curve but uh the same can
22:47 

22:47 be said like the same advice can be
22:48 

22:48 given to non-technical founders right to
22:50 

22:50 really treat learning tech as part of
22:53 

22:53 the process of being founders. It is a
22:54 

22:54 hat that you can wear too. But you have
22:57 

22:57 to have the uh um patience and humility
23:01 

23:01 to step down to ground zero to admit
23:03 

23:03 that you don't know anything and start
23:05 

23:05 learning code from scr scratch. I I I
23:07 

23:07 see so many nontechnical founders who
23:09 

23:09 just don't even want to take that first
23:10 

23:10 step. One intimidating but there are
23:12 

23:12 also two like you mentioned they don't
23:15 

23:15 think it's their responsibility but it
23:17 

23:17 is your responsibility right now if
23:18 

23:18 you're starting a tech startup. Even if
23:20 

23:20 you have a CTO, you should still be
23:22 

23:22 learning the ins and outs of what it
23:24 

23:24 takes to to uh develop a tech startup
23:27 

23:27 and understand what code means for you.
23:30 

23:30 Yeah. And um for the non-technical
23:33 

23:33 friends out there, if you have questions
23:36 

23:36 like please just reach out to anybody
23:38 

23:38 you know who has even like a a bit of
23:41 

23:41 their foot in into the technical world.
23:43 

23:43 You could you could email us, you could
23:44 

23:44 reach out to us on LinkedIn. Honestly,
23:46 

23:46 in the tech community, everybody is very
23:48 

23:48 friendly and willing to learn because in
23:50 

23:50 the tech community, we're constantly
23:52 

23:52 humbled by what we don't know. We're so
23:54 

23:54 used to starting from scratch where we
23:57 

23:57 don't know anything because tech just
23:59 

23:59 moves so fast and that's why we have so
24:01 

24:01 many uh tech communities. I mean, we're
24:03 

24:03 all in women devs SG. That's where we
24:04 

24:04 started out uh trying to learn from
24:06 

24:06 others. We constantly need to learn and
24:08 

24:08 I want to encourage our non- techie
24:10 

24:10 folks to come up try to get exposed try
24:13 

24:13 to take that first step together uh to
24:15 

24:15 to learn how to code just as we are
24:18 

24:18 right now as three techies trying to
24:20 

24:20 learn the world of content creation
24:22 

24:22 marketing doing business now right now
24:24 

24:24 we're actually learning how to do
24:25 

24:25 business um I mean yeah we have like a
24:28 

24:28 card game called techie taboo um and
24:31 

24:31 sure it was easy it was easy coding the
24:34 

24:34 code base we created an app to create uh
24:36 

24:36 uh cards. That was the easy part. Well,
24:38 

24:38 we we all did and that's how how we do
24:40 

24:40 it. But now we have to learn how to
24:42 

24:42 market it to people. Going to all these
24:45 

24:45 like different um tech community meets
24:48 

24:48 and stuff and going up to people.
24:49 

24:49 >> At least for Natasha, I'm not worried.
24:50 

24:50 Like
24:52 

24:52 >> so natural say that it's because I only
24:54 

24:54 work if I get thrown in the situation,
24:56 

24:56 but honestly, I rather eat fries at the
24:58 

24:58 side. It's very unnatural to do that.
25:00 

25:00 But you know like we're we're still
25:02 

25:02 learning uh we're learning the founder
25:04 

25:04 journey. You know we also have like a
25:06 

25:06 research initiative called future net
25:08 

25:08 going on where we're starting to look
25:10 

25:10 into the digital landscape of uh kids of
25:13 

25:13 adolescents and parents. And now we have
25:16 

25:16 to go out and do user interviews, right?
25:18 

25:18 We're software engineers. We don't do
25:19 

25:19 user interviews but now we have to. So
25:21 

25:21 we've been talking to parents. We've
25:23 

25:23 been talking to uh uh psychiatrists.
25:26 

25:26 >> We have been learning to interview cuz
25:27 

25:27 that is a skill in itself. like asking
25:30 

25:30 the right questions to get what you
25:32 

25:32 actually want out. So it has really been
25:34 

25:34 a whole journey and we have been humbled
25:37 

25:37 by so humbled. Yeah. So yeah, basically
25:41 

25:41 what we're encouraging is that
25:42 

25:42 non-technical founders trying to look
25:44 

25:44 for CTO's uh we know the search is very
25:47 

25:47 difficult and uh the reasons that we've
25:49 

25:49 stated in this video, it's a red ocean
25:51 

25:51 out there. Uh also it's very hard to get
25:53 

25:53 somebody who has the same uh product
25:56 

25:56 thinking mindset plus the same vision as
25:57 

25:57 you do. Um but the first step that you
25:60 

25:60 could take is just to start learning
26:02 

26:02 what a technical uh founder would do
26:05 

26:05 just in the same way that we're
26:07 

26:07 learning. Uh
26:08 

26:08 >> nontech found no. Yeah. We're very
26:10 

26:10 inspired by all these stories. Honestly,
26:11 

26:11 the only reason we've kept moving
26:13 

26:13 forward is seeing like hey our uh
26:15 

26:15 friends who are founders, they're
26:16 

26:16 non-technical and yet they still do it.
26:19 

26:19 How come we can't?
26:20 

26:20 >> Yeah.
26:20 

26:20 >> Yeah. So we hope that you're uh you get
26:23 

26:23 more insight out of this episode. Uh we
26:26 

26:26 hope that uh you'll also reach out to
26:28 

26:28 us. Um even if we're not able to
26:30 

26:30 directly help you, we'll be able to
26:31 

26:31 connect you to somebody who does. And uh
26:34 

26:34 as always uh this was Red Tech and we
26:36 

26:36 hope you found this episode helpful. Bye
26:40
