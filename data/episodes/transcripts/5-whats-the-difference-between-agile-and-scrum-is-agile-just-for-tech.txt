00:00 hi everyone we are re
00:03 

00:03 Tech welcome to another episode thanks
00:05 

00:05 so much for tuning in tuning in so let
00:09 

00:09 us first introduce ourselves so my name
00:11 

00:11 is Victoria I'm a Solutions engineer I'm
00:13 

00:13 Salon uh software developer you forgot
00:16 

00:16 and Natasha software engineer it's okay
00:19 

00:19 we'll put captions later and together we
00:21 

00:21 are and together we are re
00:23 

00:23 [Applause]
00:24 

00:24 [Music]
00:26 

00:26 te so this is the place for bites and
00:29 

00:29 bentor in today's episode I want to
00:32 

00:32 basically start the conversation with
00:34 

00:34 talking about scrum and you know Agile
00:36 

00:36 development I think these are Buzz words
00:38 

00:38 that's always been thrown around like in
00:40 

00:40 Tech in Tech Twitter like you know
00:42 

00:42 social media everyone maybe probably
00:45 

00:45 have this idea that scrum is like only
00:48 

00:48 tech people use it or something so
00:50 

00:50 today's episode we want to debunk some
00:52 

00:52 of it and we want to also maybe Define
00:55 

00:55 it in our own terms what is Scrum what
00:57 

00:57 is Agile development what what do all
00:58 

00:58 these words mean so maybe I start with
01:01 

01:01 Natasha so from your experience you know
01:05 

01:05 what how do you define scrum yeah so
01:08 

01:08 actually I want to start off by um
01:09 

01:09 explaining agile first um because I
01:12 

01:12 think in general these are buzzword yes
01:14 

01:14 but um all like if you hear scrum you
01:18 

01:18 hear Conan there are a lot of other
01:20 

01:20 methods even scrum bun but these are all
01:22 

01:22 Frameworks for practicing the mindset of
01:24 

01:24 agile um how I would describe this uh
01:27 

01:27 would kind of be like um agile is it's
01:30 

01:30 not so much of like a defined set of
01:32 

01:32 practices it's a mindset and a way of
01:35 

01:35 living I guess it's sort of like um if
01:38 

01:38 you know the word zen comes to mind we
01:41 

01:41 all know it's not like a prescribed way
01:43 

01:43 of like living it's a mindset and a
01:46 

01:46 lifestyle that you undertake to keep
01:48 

01:48 your mind at a calm state so that's kind
01:50 

01:50 of like the equivalent of agile but
01:52 

01:52 there are many ways of practicing Zen
01:54 

01:54 you could say I'm going to butcher this
01:56 

01:56 because I don't know like I don't know
01:58 

01:58 if the word zen but maybe um some of the
02:00 

02:00 practices you would do is you meditate
02:02 

02:02 some of the things that you want to
02:04 

02:04 teach yourself to do is um minimalism
02:06 

02:06 minimalism you know these are like
02:08 

02:08 practices to put yourself in that
02:10 

02:10 mindset of Zen again completely
02:13 

02:13 butchering this but that would be how I
02:15 

02:15 would describe the relation of aile
02:18 

02:18 versus um the other um buzz words that
02:20 

02:20 come about like scrum like uh kban so
02:24 

02:24 just to frame it in that context so now
02:26 

02:26 going back to like how I will actually
02:28 

02:28 Define agile so kind of like how how
02:30 

02:30 would you describe a mindset like Zen
02:32 

02:32 how would you describe um like the
02:35 

02:35 process of practicing Zen I think it's
02:37 

02:37 very like um difficult to just kind of
02:40 

02:40 be like oh yeah here's one 2 3 4 5 there
02:43 

02:43 is this thing called the agile Manifesto
02:45 

02:45 uh that's promulgated that has like
02:47 

02:47 different values of agile but I think
02:49 

02:49 one of the most important uh values um
02:52 

02:52 that you want to adopt uh in agile B uh
02:55 

02:55 working in a team oh so wait I should
02:57 

02:57 start out with Mar saying agile is a is
02:59 

02:59 a mindset said that you adopt when it
03:01 

03:01 comes to working in a team going back to
03:03 

03:03 your question is it just for like uh
03:05 

03:05 software engineering teams or product
03:07 

03:07 teams no it's not it's about how you um
03:10 

03:10 adopt a mindset when it comes to working
03:13 

03:13 in any team it could be a team of two
03:16 

03:16 people three people even 10 um but as
03:19 

03:19 much as possible you try to keep it lean
03:21 

03:21 um but that's kind of what agile is uh
03:23 

03:23 in terms of the values that um the agile
03:27 

03:27 uh Manifesto tends to prescribe I think
03:29 

03:29 the most important is honesty and
03:31 

03:31 openness um so it really tries to
03:34 

03:34 encourage that in a team you want to be
03:37 

03:37 uh honest and open about the process of
03:39 

03:39 whatever you're working on um I I do you
03:43 

03:43 correct me if I'm wrong I can't remember
03:44 

03:44 the manifestor off the top of my head
03:46 

03:46 but uh these I don't remember you don't
03:48 

03:48 remember yeah I see nobody like goes
03:50 

03:50 around you don't go around like
03:52 

03:52 remembering like these three uh set of
03:55 

03:55 defined criteria of how to practice it's
03:57 

03:57 just something that you adopt yeah so so
04:00 

04:00 um I think I'll just um focus on the
04:03 

04:03 honesty and openness part of it and then
04:05 

04:05 these practices um like scrum and kbon
04:09 

04:09 basically create a set of rituals and
04:11 

04:11 routines that help you um increase
04:15 

04:15 honesty and openness in a team which
04:17 

04:17 otherwise you might not be inclined to
04:19 

04:19 practice so for example um say uh in
04:24 

04:24 scrum uh in scrum there are these things
04:26 

04:26 called rituals I know it's beginning to
04:28 

04:28 sound a lot like a color I realiz yeah
04:31 

04:31 okay I realized in tech there are a lot
04:32 

04:32 of weird like culty sounding things but
04:34 

04:34 it's okay we will debunk them later um
04:37 

04:37 but say for uh scrum um a lot of it is
04:41 

04:41 about putting everything that your team
04:43 

04:43 is doing on a visual um platform that
04:46 

04:46 everybody can see um and you you might
04:50 

04:50 be using something like a what they call
04:51 

04:51 a cbam board you know which is this
04:53 

04:53 board with like three or more columns
04:56 

04:56 it's usually like um backlog in progress
04:59 

04:59 and too for for example um it could be
05:02 

05:02 any Board of any sort but what you're
05:03 

05:03 trying to achieve here is the agile uh
05:06 

05:06 value of like openness and honesty
05:09 

05:09 because you see if without a visual
05:11 

05:11 platform to see what your team is doing
05:13 

05:13 uh imagine three of us right now I have
05:16 

05:16 no clue like uh what you've done today
05:19 

05:19 and what you've done today before we all
05:20 

05:20 came here but if we were to like
05:22 

05:22 practice let's all put all our tasks on
05:25 

05:25 a board and we just try to achieve that
05:28 

05:28 kind of openness between all all three
05:30 

05:30 of us where we can see everything that
05:31 

05:31 we're doing that's uh what agile is like
05:34 

05:34 that ritual of putting everything on a
05:36 

05:36 board so um that's one of the artifacts
05:40 

05:40 like a visual platform to see everything
05:41 

05:41 that a team is doing uh scrum and Kuman
05:45 

05:45 also uh prescribe uh rituals like I
05:47 

05:47 think you've heard stand-ups y um I
05:49 

05:49 think we've all done a standup you've
05:51 

05:51 heard of like uh Retros you've heard of
05:54 

05:54 like Sprint plannings these are all
05:56 

05:56 individual events and sessions um and
05:59 

05:59 practice
06:00 

06:00 uh where you come together to try to um
06:04 

06:04 use that visual platform and communicate
06:07 

06:07 uh as much information as you can about
06:09 

06:09 what exactly um each of these tasks
06:12 

06:12 represent to you and you try to
06:13 

06:13 reorganize these tasks if it doesn't um
06:17 

06:17 if there's conflict so for example
06:19 

06:19 stand-ups are um everyday practices um
06:23 

06:23 it can be everyday it could be like once
06:25 

06:25 dep on the team dependent on the team
06:27 

06:27 right but the whole practice is that you
06:29 

06:29 want a
06:30 

06:30 uh frequent check in where everybody for
06:33 

06:33 15 minutes um kind of like sounds out
06:36 

06:36 what they're doing um with the eight of
06:39 

06:39 usually the visual platform like hey I'm
06:40 

06:40 doing this Tas and um usually go through
06:43 

06:43 the process of like this is what I've
06:45 

06:45 done these are my blockers so that part
06:47 

06:47 is like very important telling people
06:49 

06:49 like actually uh I'm blocked by um this
06:51 

06:51 other task that my member of my team uh
06:53 

06:53 has done like how do I uh can we talk
06:56 

06:56 after like this stand up to kind of
06:57 

06:57 Unblock that so stand up is kind of like
06:60 

06:60 that I realized like this is going to be
07:01 

07:01 like a really long conversation so I do
07:04 

07:04 want to pass the baon on to like Salone
07:06 

07:06 to explain the other practices like
07:08 

07:08 Sprint planning and retrospective it's
07:10 

07:10 going to be a very long like framing
07:11 

07:11 session because now I realize if I were
07:13 

07:13 to put it in a Layman's perspective it
07:16 

07:16 it all would sound kind of odd so yeah
07:18 

07:18 do uh help me out like uh in terms of
07:20 

07:20 explaining the other rituals that you
07:22 

07:22 practice um actually like don't mind I
07:26 

07:26 might take a turn of events now uh so so
07:30 

07:30 yes uh agile very nice to explain like
07:33 

07:33 the it's it's a philosophy and then the
07:36 

07:36 scrum is a way of practicing that and
07:39 

07:39 Canan and there are these rituals inside
07:42 

07:42 it uh like we can talk about all of
07:45 

07:45 these together like there are a lot of
07:46 

07:46 things there are different variations of
07:48 

07:48 each of these things but maybe I can put
07:50 

07:50 out my perspective out uh so you said
07:54 

07:54 that agile is about honesty openness uh
07:58 

07:58 that's one way of looking at it also
07:60 

07:60 disclaimer we are not experts in any of
08:02 

08:02 these this is just from our experience
08:04 

08:04 working in in our
08:06 

08:06 organizations uh and like how we
08:08 

08:08 practiced it so that there might be
08:10 

08:10 other definitions other ways of doing
08:12 

08:12 things so how I see it is uh I actually
08:16 

08:16 entered the tech industry at a time
08:19 

08:19 where the companies I was working for
08:22 

08:22 were kind of trans transitioning into
08:25 

08:25 agile or like uh they were halfway there
08:27 

08:27 or something like that so I still know
08:30 

08:30 what is the the not agile way of working
08:34 

08:34 which which was called waterfall model
08:37 

08:37 so I think if I like bring it from that
08:38 

08:38 perspective it might bring some more
08:41 

08:41 insight that's maybe you can tell us
08:44 

08:44 like waterfall versus
08:46 

08:46 edel you know so very very simply simply
08:48 

08:48 put so I uh I I only know about a tech
08:52 

08:52 way of working so yes this can be
08:54 

08:54 applied in other Industries as well but
08:56 

08:56 I will bring the tech sure perspective
08:59 

08:59 uh so waterfall very simply put in a
09:01 

09:01 software team uh the waterfall way of
09:04 

09:04 working was uh first you a team sits
09:08 

09:08 down they design the UI for example then
09:12 

09:12 they start building then they start
09:15 

09:15 testing so it's a a step by step then
09:19 

09:19 after they start testing it then they
09:21 

09:21 will push it out release it then there
09:23 

09:23 will be Buck coming in so then you'll go
09:26 

09:26 back to the starting you design you
09:28 

09:28 implemented test it and then you release
09:31 

09:31 it out so you can imagine this happening
09:34 

09:34 step by step nothing would be in
09:36 

09:36 parallel you have to wait for the
09:38 

09:38 previous step to finish for the next
09:40 

09:40 step to begin and what then happens is
09:42 

09:42 it takes a super long time for your
09:45 

09:45 software to come out right to fix bugs
09:47 

09:47 for example so then they came up with
09:50 

09:50 this agile way of working where be a bit
09:53 

09:53 more flexible uh and the the main thing
09:56 

09:56 the main difference between the two was
09:58 

09:58 that uh uh it should
10:01 

10:01 be so instead of having this way of
10:04 

10:04 working in a software team it would be
10:06 

10:06 uh so the reason why you're working in
10:08 

10:08 this waterall model and in this manner
10:10 

10:10 is because you have one
10:12 

10:12 service everyone works on that same
10:14 

10:14 service so it makes sense that only
10:16 

10:16 after I implement it I pass it to you
10:19 

10:19 you test it you can test while I'm
10:21 

10:21 building it right right but a jel
10:24 

10:24 brought about a lot of more ways of
10:26 

10:26 thinking in that have microservices
10:28 

10:28 multiple teams are working on on
10:30 

10:30 different things once you have done the
10:33 

10:33 UI even if you're halfway done give it
10:36 

10:36 out to the to the beta uh beta con
10:39 

10:39 customers uh like Photoshop copies or
10:42 

10:42 like mock uis see if it even works out
10:47 

10:47 before you start building it and while
10:50 

10:50 this is happening uh you can take the
10:52 

10:52 first part start building that while
10:54 

10:54 they're making the next part of it and
10:57 

10:57 keep validating keep uh testing while
10:60 

10:60 it's being done so that's how I see it
11:03 

11:03 like so that's the agile way of working
11:06 

11:06 more I don't know how to like say like
11:09 

11:09 it's not step by step it's more
11:11 

11:11 incoherent like everything's happening
11:13 

11:13 getting feedback constant feedback
11:15 

11:15 constant uh continuous delivery that's
11:18 

11:18 where those delivery we can definitely
11:20 

11:20 have a SE separate uh session in terms
11:22 

11:22 of like C CD continuation so yeah that's
11:25 

11:25 where all these these thumbs came up
11:27 

11:27 exactly they all came from like a
11:29 

11:29 actually thank you for taking a step
11:31 

11:31 back and I realized it's really hard to
11:33 

11:33 explain likeo if it's kind of like you
11:36 

11:36 asking me like um uh how why is your
11:40 

11:40 personality like that yeah it's it's a
11:42 

11:42 very complex thing and you can come from
11:44 

11:44 different angles and it's a very big
11:46 

11:46 thing as well like for example the
11:47 

11:47 openers uh honest feedback stuff that is
11:51 

11:51 also part of a yeah because without it
11:53 

11:53 you can't that's how that's how you can
11:56 

11:56 do this continuous delivery that's how
11:58 

11:58 you can be efficient
11:60 

11:60 so the whole philosophy is how to be
12:03 

12:03 efficiently delivering items in a very
12:07 

12:07 systematic Manner and that's like so so
12:11 

12:11 we will work in Sprints we would have
12:13 

12:13 retrospective after every Sprint to see
12:16 

12:16 where can we improve and how can we get
12:19 

12:19 how can we work better as a team so
12:21 

12:21 everything's very team oriented and
12:23 

12:23 everyone's very focused on you know we
12:25 

12:25 want the best of the product and I I
12:28 

12:28 guess that's why the other
12:30 

12:30 roles come in you know product managers
12:32 

12:32 designers testers and there's also scrum
12:36 

12:36 Master oh can we maybe talk about you
12:40 

12:40 know what the scram Master does it
12:42 

12:42 sounds really like you know the cult
12:44 

12:44 Master honestly the word scrum can we
12:46 

12:46 talk about how ugly this term is who
12:49 

12:49 created a word scrum I don't think it
12:50 

12:50 stands for anything scrub scrum like
12:52 

12:52 scrubbing scrum of the earth I don't
12:54 

12:54 know okay but there is a legitimate job
12:57 

12:57 title called the scrum master yeah and a
13:01 

13:01 like quick fact I actually did I don't
13:04 

13:04 know if it's the truth now but at some
13:06 

13:06 point like a couple of years ago scrum
13:09 

13:09 master was the highest earning role in
13:12 

13:12 Tech what that's insane even more than a
13:15 

13:15 software developer even more than a
13:16 

13:16 product manager it's the highest paid
13:19 

13:19 then can you expl what a daytoday scrum
13:22 

13:22 Master job look like the scrum Master's
13:24 

13:24 job is actually unrelated to like
13:27 

13:27 anything technical if you think about it
13:28 

13:28 you could put him in any team and his
13:30 

13:30 whole job is to uh prescribe this set of
13:33 

13:33 rituals and make sure that the team like
13:35 

13:35 follows it he's basically the one that
13:38 

13:38 um lives and briefs the culture and
13:40 

13:40 tries to like spread it to people and
13:42 

13:42 make sure that the context of scrum how
13:44 

13:44 can it be applied to this specific team
13:47 

13:47 uh I've seen like uh organizations like
13:49 

13:49 high there are scrum Masters that
13:50 

13:50 prescrib to like each team but there are
13:53 

13:53 also like organizational like uh scrum
13:56 

13:56 uh Team like Masters within like a uh
13:59 

13:59 very much floating team that tries to
14:01 

14:01 make sure that culture is cerent across
14:03 

14:03 the organization but another like scrum
14:05 

14:05 Masters basically prescribe like the
14:08 

14:08 methodology of scrum you also have like
14:10 

14:10 in uh kban uh agile coaches so same
14:13 

14:13 thing but for agile coaches then they're
14:15 

14:15 trying to like spread the culture of
14:17 

14:17 kban so a lot of these terms but yeah
14:19 

14:19 it's surprising to me that they I mean a
14:22 

14:22 few years ago I don't know if it's the
14:23 

14:23 case now cuz I don't see much scrum
14:26 

14:26 masters job post coming up I don't know
14:29 

14:29 I I it's just my what I think so but at
14:32 

14:32 that point I did know that it is the
14:34 

14:34 highest paid job and so what does scrum
14:36 

14:36 Master does is basically because it is a
14:39 

14:39 way of uh living right so the scrum
14:42 

14:42 master has to inculcate the the change
14:46 

14:46 like people will still be stuck like 10
14:49 

14:49 for example I'm working for 10 years
14:50 

14:50 doing waterfall model it it's very hard
14:53 

14:53 to change me and my way of thinking
14:55 

14:55 right so this person comes in and he
14:57 

14:57 will try to change the way the whole
14:59 

14:59 team Works in um like there'll be some
15:02 

15:02 practices we'll do to to you know first
15:05 

15:05 step second step up to get into the
15:08 

15:08 agile way of
15:10 

15:10 working so like forcing two people to
15:12 

15:12 sit together and talk about feedback how
15:15 

15:15 to give feedback things like that and
15:17 

15:17 like retrospective how does it work and
15:19 

15:19 like making the team think like having a
15:22 

15:22 blameless culture also you know like oh
15:25 

15:25 she was slow that's why we couldn't meet
15:26 

15:26 the deadline but then they would ask
15:29 

15:29 questions like but why do you think she
15:32 

15:32 was doing it that manner so then it's
15:34 

15:34 like uh I was actually blocked for for 2
15:37 

15:37 days then why didn't you raise it that's
15:40 

15:40 when standup comes in then I think we
15:41 

15:41 need a stand up where everyone every day
15:44 

15:44 will raise their blockers I love it in a
15:46 

15:46 safe environment you know like so it's a
15:49 

15:49 it's a if you think about it and you
15:50 

15:50 read up all of these stories it's
15:52 

15:52 actually a very very nice way of working
15:55 

15:55 together you it's like also cultivating
15:57 

15:57 empathy among the
15:60 

15:60 that's very good I like the
16:01 

16:01 blamelessness and I like how it does
16:04 

16:04 have that aspect to it but I mean it
16:06 

16:06 could be just my experience with my team
16:08 

16:08 that I worked with uh so but at the same
16:11 

16:11 time it's not something that you can
16:12 

16:12 just read about it it's something that
16:14 

16:14 you have to practice and then you
16:16 

16:16 realize what it is you realize it to a
16:17 

16:17 point that you don't even use the words
16:19 

16:19 agile and scrum anymore and come on
16:20 

16:20 anymore like it will naturally become
16:22 

16:22 automatic right and that's when the
16:24 

16:24 scrum Master would leave the team when
16:25 

16:25 the team is ready to work by itself it's
16:29 

16:29 it's a dis it has to be a dispensable
16:31 

16:31 role that's the most important part um
16:34 

16:34 and actually I I also want to take a
16:36 

16:36 step back acknowledging that we're both
16:38 

16:38 like um very deep in this process
16:40 

16:40 because we practice it but for Victoria
16:42 

16:42 yourself like you're a Solutions
16:43 

16:43 engineer and um you don't necessarily
16:46 

16:46 like practice what's your perspective
16:48 

16:48 want to put in that thing because I know
16:51 

16:51 that we mentioned how you know the
16:52 

16:52 openness the honesty cultivating empathy
16:55 

16:55 all these points are really good at you
16:57 

16:57 know we can apply it to any team teams
16:59 

16:59 regardless whether they're Tech or not
17:01 

17:01 so my team is very Tech but the nature
17:03 

17:03 of our job is not
17:06 

17:06 collaborative actually because we will
17:09 

17:09 each have our own clients and we each
17:12 

17:12 have our own problems to solve to create
17:15 

17:15 solutions for so the only collaboration
17:18 

17:18 we would do is sharing knowledge to each
17:20 

17:20 other like I share a lot of
17:22 

17:22 documentation and solution design and
17:24 

17:24 you know like T tips and things that I
17:26 

17:26 learn about the product like newer
17:27 

17:27 products I tested for my team so all
17:30 

17:30 these testing and like collaboration is
17:33 

17:33 the type of collaboration we do but in
17:36 

17:36 terms of you know getting to a goal or
17:39 

17:39 objective together our team is just
17:42 

17:42 working in silos like to be honest
17:44 

17:44 that's the nature of our job is to have
17:46 

17:46 our you know deal with our own clients
17:48 

17:48 dayto day and yeah there's not like an
17:51 

17:51 objective together that we pursue so
17:54 

17:54 that's why it want I want to kind of go
17:56 

17:56 back and ask you guys like we talk about
17:58 

17:58 like the benefits of agile and scrum
18:01 

18:01 like this philosophy to like efficiently
18:03 

18:03 you know continuously have that feedback
18:06 

18:06 but what do you think might be some of
18:08 

18:08 the drawbacks of adopting scrum an agile
18:11 

18:11 mindset that's such a good question yeah
18:13 

18:13 I actually know one like I was already
18:15 

18:15 smiling when you said that cuz I thought
18:17 

18:17 like a few examples in my mind so I mean
18:20 

18:20 like cuz it's a way of working right not
18:23 

18:23 everyone would be okay with changing
18:24 

18:24 firstly not everyone would be okay with
18:27 

18:27 uh the new way of working cuz uh one
18:31 

18:31 thing that I always hear is too many
18:35 

18:35 meetings yeah observe that yeah cuz it
18:38 

18:38 does happen there will be 30 minute
18:40 

18:40 standups it might if you're not very
18:42 

18:42 concise in your standup uh what you're
18:44 

18:44 saying it might drag on to like 40
18:46 

18:46 minutes and no one says anything you we
18:48 

18:48 all TCH people will there be like a team
18:50 

18:50 lead who can like mitigate that by yeah
18:52 

18:52 so it it is good to appoint someone like
18:55 

18:55 it is your duty to stop us like again
18:60 

18:60 scrum Master yeah so we actually do that
19:02 

19:02 in our team like we would have one of us
19:04 

19:04 appointed as the scrum Master of the
19:06 

19:06 week for example so that person has to
19:08 

19:08 just keep note of time agenda so that we
19:10 

19:10 don't go out of context and cuz cuz we
19:13 

19:13 for example you're meeting for stand up
19:14 

19:14 in the morning and then in the evening
19:17 

19:17 uh in the afternoon there's Sprint
19:18 

19:18 planning for the next 2 weeks and then
19:21 

19:21 at the end there's retrospective for the
19:23 

19:23 week before yeah that is like two and a
19:25 

19:25 half hours of your day wow so
19:29 

19:29 there can be too many it it can be
19:31 

19:31 pointless sometimes if you don't if
19:33 

19:33 you're not mindful of like wait this
19:35 

19:35 could just be uh email like if you're
19:37 

19:37 just telling us something without not
19:39 

19:39 having a discussion it could just be a
19:41 

19:41 email then do you advise people like
19:43 

19:43 before the meetings to prepare exactly
19:45 

19:45 their talking points instead you know
19:46 

19:46 going so then this confence comes up in
19:48 

19:48 our retrospective where actually guys
19:50 

19:50 have too many guys and girls we had too
19:54 

19:54 many meetings in this uh week so maybe
19:57 

19:57 we can uh you know
19:59 

19:59 cut it shorter or like just have written
20:01 

20:01 standups some days or things like that
20:04 

20:04 so it's always continuously improving
20:07 

20:07 continuously delivering so curious part
20:11 

20:11 yeah I'm curious of Natasha's
20:12 

20:12 perspective on like what could be the
20:14 

20:14 drawbacks cuz I think yeah of adopting
20:17 

20:17 the agile mindset I definely agree with
20:19 

20:19 like the too much meetings and that's
20:21 

20:21 why I think the role of a scrum master
20:23 

20:23 of some some some sort the person that
20:25 

20:25 upholds that culture is important
20:27 

20:27 because I think it's important to note
20:28 

20:28 it it's not a defined set of rules it is
20:30 

20:30 a mindset that you have to tailor to the
20:32 

20:32 current context of the team so you
20:34 

20:34 definitely need somebody to have that
20:36 

20:36 objective perspective he's not involved
20:38 

20:38 so much so in the product and trying to
20:41 

20:41 his goal is not the product his goal is
20:43 

20:43 trying to get a team to work most
20:45 

20:45 efficiently to product which is sort of
20:46 

20:46 like Inception within like itself but
20:49 

20:49 because he can objectively see like okay
20:51 

20:51 I see that people are getting disengage
20:53 

20:53 I see people are not really benefiting
20:54 

20:54 I'm getting feedback um so he's applying
20:57 

20:57 this iterative process
20:60 

20:60 at the same time he's encouraging an
21:01 

21:01 iterative process in terms of like the
21:03 

21:03 software development he's also applying
21:05 

21:05 the same iterative process in terms of
21:07 

21:07 like the culture that he's trying to
21:08 

21:08 inculcate so he will be the one who
21:10 

21:10 takes a step back and like manages I
21:12 

21:12 think this is why the scr Master at that
21:13 

21:13 point was the highest paid position
21:15 

21:15 probably it's actually yeah like um
21:18 

21:18 there are a lot of like people um who go
21:22 

21:22 through like the scrum certification and
21:23 

21:23 stuff like that and they think it's a
21:25 

21:25 prescribed set of processes these people
21:27 

21:27 go into team and they don't make any
21:29 

21:29 changes to the team but the really good
21:31 

21:31 scrum Masters can really make a break
21:34 

21:34 like a product and I think that's why at
21:36 

21:36 that point it was so um like high paying
21:38 

21:38 but I think at this current point it's
21:40 

21:40 kind of like saturated a lot of people
21:42 

21:42 are capitalizing that scrum Master
21:45 

21:45 certifications Like official
21:47 

21:47 certifications ceri scrum Master yeah
21:49 

21:49 you can't understand what it means to be
21:52 

21:52 agile in a two-day boot camp like I
21:55 

21:55 honestly I've never taken like a scrum
21:56 

21:56 certificate but have I gone into teams
21:58 

21:58 and change cultures I can touch my heart
21:60 

21:60 and sit that I have um it's I think
22:03 

22:03 right now uh people are capitalizing on
22:06 

22:06 the best with the agile and scrum is and
22:08 

22:08 making these courses and it's diluting
22:11 

22:11 and saturating that market and people
22:13 

22:13 are starting to not understand that
22:14 

22:14 importance anymore and I think this
22:16 

22:16 needs to change I think I want to also
22:18 

22:18 like um take this is the drawback of
22:20 

22:20 scrum actually that I want to talk about
22:21 

22:21 in AEL that right now people treat it as
22:24 

22:24 a buzzword they no longer treat it as a
22:27 

22:27 culture and a way of working in a team
22:29 

22:29 it's a way to like increase your value
22:31 

22:31 worth in the
22:33 

22:33 market um and I think that's the main
22:35 

22:35 drawback you now you I I cringe when
22:38 

22:38 people say agile I cringe when people
22:39 

22:39 say scrum because if you truly truly
22:41 

22:41 practice it you don't even need to use
22:42 

22:42 the word and I kind of want to take a
22:44 

22:44 step back into uh I was actually
22:46 

22:46 reflecting on um you kind of brought it
22:48 

22:48 up is it really like something in a tech
22:50 

22:50 industry or not and actually it's not
22:52 

22:52 it's a way of working that not only
22:54 

22:54 applies to teens but actually
22:57 

22:57 individuals as well um I was reflecting
22:59 

22:59 on how like I've kind of lived and
23:01 

23:01 breathed this culture so much even in my
23:03 

23:03 day-to-day work that I can't actually
23:05 

23:05 see like myself going back to the
23:07 

23:07 waterfall method anymore the way that we
23:09 

23:09 were even in this podcast look at how
23:11 

23:11 we've kind of like just been like okay
23:13 

23:13 we have this idea no idea how we're
23:15 

23:15 going to do it let's just go into it
23:17 

23:17 maintain the openness and communication
23:19 

23:19 within us um and Institute feedback work
23:23 

23:23 yeah have a lot feedback work on it
23:25 

23:25 that's why we keep getting our viewers
23:26 

23:26 to like can you comment and feedback
23:27 

23:27 because we you you truly are agile when
23:29 

23:29 you truly are looking forward to
23:33 

23:33 criticism that was a breakthrough for me
23:35 

23:35 where I realized I was not afraid of
23:37 

23:37 criticism anymore I was looking for it
23:39 

23:39 that is how you live and brief like atro
23:42 

23:42 because you want to like continuously
23:44 

23:44 improve on like see how this podcast
23:45 

23:45 Works um so and even uh as a now
23:49 

23:49 whenever I embark on a process uh I
23:52 

23:52 always know that it's iterative there is
23:53 

23:53 no point of perfection you know I don't
23:55 

23:55 even know what the ideal state is but I
23:57 

23:57 know what the goal is like for this
23:58 

23:58 podcast I know our goal is to like um be
24:01 

24:01 able to deliver high quality Tech
24:02 

24:02 content in like the least techy way
24:05 

24:05 possible we didn't know how we were
24:06 

24:06 going to um do it but I feel we've come
24:09 

24:09 to like a state where we kind of know
24:10 

24:10 what it is but we're still in that
24:12 

24:12 process we're always iterating basically
24:15 

24:15 where I'm already living and breathing
24:16 

24:16 Edo know exactly no exactly yeah
24:19 

24:19 Victoria tell me about your process like
24:21 

24:21 how did you feel about working in this
24:23 

24:23 team like for us it might be sort of
24:24 

24:24 like natural but for for you how did you
24:27 

24:27 feel a difference so actually I I got
24:29 

24:29 exposed to it outside my job so just a
24:32 

24:32 bit through hackathons you know with my
24:34 

24:34 friends and also I have a sister who's a
24:37 

24:37 software engineer she'll often just tell
24:39 

24:39 me all about her standups and all that
24:41 

24:41 so I I get the gist uh but I never live
24:44 

24:44 and breathe it
24:46 

24:46 until so it's really good to learn from
24:49 

24:49 you guys and learn how to do things I
24:50 

24:50 think it's really like the most
24:52 

24:52 efficient way to always constantly get
24:54 

24:54 feedback and like you mentioned not be
24:55 

24:55 afraid of criticism I think when someone
24:58 

24:58 no one Praises too much right like
25:00 

25:00 nothing but compliments you end up
25:02 

25:02 feeling that it's no longer like it's
25:05 

25:05 not as valuable you know you want to
25:07 

25:07 find
25:08 

25:08 constructive criticism in between those
25:10 

25:10 compliments so that you can grow from
25:13 

25:13 there so like what you mentioned not be
25:14 

25:14 afraid of that I think that's also the
25:16 

25:16 mindset that we can all adopt and I'm
25:18 

25:18 glad we have adopted for this podcast
25:21 

25:21 and I don't know if there's any time
25:23 

25:23 left but I have like one very
25:26 

25:26 interesting random question so since you
25:27 

25:27 both are
25:28 

25:28 technically SC Masters without the title
25:32 

25:32 I can't okay I'll just technically you
25:35 

25:35 guys have lived and Bre I
25:39 

25:39 experience that way of living so um do
25:42 

25:42 you agree that do you think it's for
25:44 

25:44 everyone for any kind of team because
25:46 

25:46 like I mentioned in my team it's kind of
25:48 

25:48 like the nature of our job itself it's
25:50 

25:50 hard because we don't have like the same
25:53 

25:53 goal is there a way that we can somehow
25:55 

25:55 integrate that to even teams who have
25:57 

25:57 different different objectives but like
25:60 

25:60 technically they are the same role that
26:02 

26:02 kind like yeah I'm not sure maybe any of
26:05 

26:05 you have a comment that if I were to
26:07 

26:07 bring you guys to my organization right
26:10 

26:10 now as a SC Master somebody practicing
26:13 

26:13 as someone who wants to adopt this
26:15 

26:15 practice uh how would that look
26:18 

26:18 like uh do you want me to comment on it
26:21 

26:21 sure like after top of my head I
26:23 

26:23 actually would say no it's not for
26:24 

26:24 everyone and this is a hard lesson that
26:26 

26:26 I've learned um I think we talked about
26:29 

26:29 this in a previous episode about how
26:30 

26:30 like I'm I've always been in a state of
26:32 

26:32 zero to one products like I'm always
26:34 

26:34 starting things I think ago is
26:36 

26:36 definitely the way to go to start new
26:39 

26:39 things um where you're still in the
26:41 

26:41 process of experimenting and prototyping
26:43 

26:43 new processes and that's why you need
26:45 

26:45 that iterative um uh like element of it
26:48 

26:48 but I I feel like in existing
26:51 

26:51 organizations and already like very
26:53 

26:53 large Enterprises and I could be wrong
26:55 

26:55 because both of you have worked in
26:56 

26:56 larger organizations but I do see a
26:59 

26:59 pattern where trying to superimpose like
27:02 

27:02 agile just doesn't work in that context
27:05 

27:05 because you're in this context and
27:07 

27:07 business function where your main goal
27:09 

27:09 is no longer experimentation you already
27:11 

27:11 have like a process that's tried and
27:13 

27:13 tested you have a product that uh is
27:17 

27:17 high States because people recognize a
27:19 

27:19 product for that standard and quality
27:21 

27:21 that it is you have a set of processes
27:23 

27:23 uh that you know definitely work so try
27:26 

27:26 trying to impost agile in that context
27:29 

27:29 um it just creates a lot of friction in
27:31 

27:31 a team there is a reason why I I do
27:34 

27:34 think things um have a natural form of
27:36 

27:36 Divergence and convergence agile is that
27:38 

27:38 Divergence where you're trying different
27:40 

27:40 things out trying to experiment with
27:41 

27:41 what works but when things start working
27:43 

27:43 you you see things start conversing like
27:45 

27:45 for example for this podcast we realized
27:47 

27:47 that um meeting at this certain Cadence
27:49 

27:49 work we're going to stick to it this is
27:51 

27:51 no longer something we're going to
27:52 

27:52 experiment with because we want to
27:53 

27:53 release bandwith to experiment in other
27:55 

27:55 areas and and this is the same thing for
27:58 

27:58 for for um teams that have skill I feel
28:01 

28:01 they've come to a process where okay and
28:03 

28:03 we've done the experimentation we know
28:05 

28:05 this works now we need to switch our
28:07 

28:07 mindset to start defining cleanly our
28:10 

28:10 silos and I think that's why you see
28:12 

28:12 yourself in a silo because um you go
28:15 

28:15 from a process where everybody's cross
28:16 

28:16 functional and lean but once you realize
28:19 

28:19 what you have to do you start like
28:21 

28:21 having more specialized and defined um
28:24 

28:24 roles and that naturally leads to uh
28:26 

28:26 silos like in your case um uh not that I
28:30 

28:30 know exactly like what you do in your
28:31 

28:31 work but um your your process have led
28:35 

28:35 you to U focus on one client at a time
28:38 

28:38 each of you and the other solution
28:40 

28:40 Engineers have like a a body of clients
28:43 

28:43 that you are more specialized in and
28:46 

28:46 naturally those silos would be created
28:48 

28:48 but doesn't mean that it's a binary
28:50 

28:50 either you do Agile you do waterful it
28:52 

28:52 also doesn't mean that you still have to
28:54 

28:54 inculcate the culture of honesty of
28:56 

28:56 transparency but different ways rituals
28:59 

28:59 and forms um and this will turn out in
29:02 

29:02 um very different uh ways in big
29:05 

29:05 Enterprises and across these different
29:07 

29:07 Industries as well so that's my
29:08 

29:08 perspective on it I I don't think that
29:10 

29:10 AO should be superimposed on anyone like
29:12 

29:12 certain parts of the values yes but it
29:14 

29:14 depends on like the context but for
29:17 

29:17 Salone uh I actually think it I mean I I
29:21 

29:21 feel to say it but I actually think it
29:23 

29:23 can be applied in any situation of
29:26 

29:26 course I Haven have not seen all
29:27 

29:27 situations the but I think it can be
29:30 

29:30 applied to your situation I see it as if
29:33 

29:33 as like so I was in one organization
29:35 

29:35 where we had this thing called large
29:37 

29:37 scale scrum o so uh it's a thing by
29:41 

29:41 itself so we had a separate organization
29:43 

29:43 come in to inculcate that values in us
29:46 

29:46 we were doing aile as well but uh not
29:49 

29:49 this large scale scrum so imagine having
29:52 

29:52 multiple teams so six to seven teams
29:54 

29:54 they have their own product so together
29:57 

29:57 as a team we will do large SC we will do
29:59 

29:59 scrum so we'll come together for Sprint
30:01 

30:01 planning all seven teams and we will
30:04 

30:04 cross teams so that we know what each of
30:06 

30:06 the other team is doing what are they
30:08 

30:08 working on we'll provide our own
30:10 

30:10 perspective to the estimations to The
30:13 

30:13 Grooming and at first there was a lot of
30:16 

30:16 friction a lot of like why are we
30:17 

30:17 wasting time learning about this other
30:19 

30:19 product why are we doing this why are we
30:21 

30:21 doing that but then we realized we
30:23 

30:23 started learning from each other like oh
30:25 

30:25 actually that team is doing doing the
30:27 

30:27 same thing in a certain way we could
30:29 

30:29 just reuse their components or something
30:31 

30:31 then we realize wait a lot of us are
30:32 

30:32 doing almost the same things in
30:34 

30:34 different ways we repeating code basic
30:37 

30:37 repeating Services we started
30:39 

30:39 collaborating a lot more and also we
30:42 

30:42 eventually what started happening was we
30:44 

30:44 had shared knowledge of the products so
30:48 

30:48 no one person or one team was crucial
30:52 

30:52 for anything so they the whole team
30:54 

30:54 could be gone for a
30:56 

30:56 vacation the product still runs yes
30:58 

30:58 because of dispensability so then I
31:01 

31:01 think that applies to your situation
31:03 

31:03 where you have one person a has Cent a
31:06 

31:06 person Cent B and many others but if you
31:09 

31:09 shared all your knowledge your your
31:11 

31:11 knowledge base your the products you
31:13 

31:13 have built the demos you have done uh
31:16 

31:16 maybe you can reuse bits of each other
31:19 

31:19 you can cover for each other even better
31:21 

31:21 no one would be so stressed out that
31:24 

31:24 well I can't go for a leave in the next
31:26 

31:26 3 months because this is crucial yeah
31:29 

31:29 your colleague can just take over for
31:30 

31:30 for you for that time period or they can
31:32 

31:32 answer questions of the clients because
31:35 

31:35 I know what's happening I I love that I
31:37 

31:37 love that I I really do because I think
31:40 

31:40 that we have done some kind of I guess
31:43 

31:43 we didn't realize it oursel but some
31:45 

31:45 kind of scrum CU we do often share our
31:48 

31:48 product knowledge as well as the demos
31:50 

31:50 we tested each other demos and also
31:51 

31:51 tested new products and sharing that
31:54 

31:54 like things that we find out from you
31:56 

31:56 know testing so we have we have done a
31:58 

31:58 lot of those and that's why I do find it
31:60 

31:60 easy kind of to cover when someone's on
32:02 

32:02 leave so when any of my team members is
32:05 

32:05 on leave and they just give me a brief
32:07 

32:07 overview what this client needs what is
32:09 

32:09 the solution that we're recommending I
32:11 

32:11 immediately okay I know what to do like
32:13 

32:13 if she brought me to the meeting I would
32:15 

32:15 be like yeah I can I can explain it the
32:18 

32:18 same way she probably does yeah so I
32:20 

32:20 think that openness in communication and
32:23 

32:23 constant iterating is what um is what is
32:27 

32:27 all I think I just gained an EP I just
32:30 

32:30 got you have been doing it like I have
32:32 

32:32 been but it's just it's kind of like
32:35 

32:35 discreet yeah it's like not as obvious
32:37 

32:37 as like product teams right who share
32:39 

32:39 the same objectives it's because my team
32:41 

32:41 each of us have different incentives and
32:43 

32:43 that's why it might not be as obvious
32:46 

32:46 wow I think this is a very enlightening
32:49 

32:49 episode I don't know about you guys but
32:50 

32:50 for me it's yeah it's actually a huge
32:53 

32:53 topic yeah it's actually we can go on
32:55 

32:55 forever and it's actually like such a
32:57 

32:57 huge umbrella that there's even like
32:59 

32:59 branches of it we can like how we
33:00 

33:00 mention the death Ops cicd right that is
33:03 

33:03 also part of it future episode yeah I
33:07 

33:07 would actually like to hear from like
33:08 

33:08 our audience if you can like comment in
33:11 

33:11 on our YouTube or like somewhere I would
33:12 

33:12 like to hear more perspectives like I
33:14 

33:14 actually didn't didn't talk about a with
33:16 

33:16 anyone before and like I heard her
33:18 

33:18 perspective like oh actually I didn't
33:20 

33:20 realize that a lot of things were
33:22 

33:22 happening while we're doing this that's
33:24 

33:24 nice like more yeah in terms of like
33:27 

33:27 after the viewers like view this episode
33:29 

33:29 what are the questions that's popping up
33:31 

33:31 your so we can take this into another
33:32 

33:32 episode because I realize because we all
33:34 

33:34 practice it some way somehow it's very
33:36 

33:36 hard to see from like an outsider's
33:37 

33:37 perspective so we really want that and
33:40 

33:40 we want those questions yeah and this is
33:41 

33:41 also part of gaining that feedback and
33:43 

33:43 you know developing ourselves so yeah so
